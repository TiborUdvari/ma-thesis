ABOUT REV 0011 - 28 november 2001,,11,2001-11-28 00:00:00-05:00,"i've changed (broken) enough things in this new release that i'm
writing down a list of changes. your programs may run a little funny
in rev 11, but it's all for the better in the long run. let me know if
you have trouble getting things to work. and of course, keep a copy of
rev 9 around in case things go wrong.

that said, rev 11 should be a much happier place to work. due to the
harrassment of your classmates, i've completed (simple) font support,
among other things.

[for those who missed rev 10, it only existed for 15 minutes, because a
bug was found as i was preparing to send it out.]



FONTS are working. a simple example:

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
  setFont(loadFont(""fonts/Univers76.vlw.gz""));
  fill(200, 200, 00);
  background(10, 70, 200);
}

void loop() {
  rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
  translate(mouseX, mouseY);
  scale(20, 20);
  text(""I'm a little typeface short and stout"", 0, 0);
}

the 0, 0 part at the end of 'text' is the x, y location to put it. 
the scale(20, 20) means 20 point font (fonts are 1 pixel high). 
(note that with the scale() in there, the x, y coords for text() will
also be multiplied by 20x.)

bunch of cheezy fonts are included in a 'fonts' directory. not
sure if i'll include these in the future, but at least it's a start.



IMAGES are working. a simple example:

BagelImage b;

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
  fill(100);
  b = loadImage(""max_van_kleek.gif"");
}

void loop() {
  image(b, mouseX, mouseY);
}

this drags poor max around the screen with the mouse position. the
image should be in the same directory as run.bat. jpeg images can be
used too.



RANDOM() functions, more random than ever

// get a float between 0 and 40, or [0..40) for math weenies
float a = random(40);

// get a float between -1 and 1
float b = random(-1, 1);

// get an int between 0 and 9
int c = (int) random(10);



PIXELS... you want them

pixels[] is an int array that contains all of the image data from the
screen, in ARGB format (packed into ints). play away.

if you don't know what that means and would like to use the pixel
array directly, let me know.



FIXED WIDTH FONTS

make-your-own-fixed-width-fonts-in-photoshop are supported.
but i'm not gonna bother documenting them unless someone asks.



ALTERCATIONS

+ rect(x, y, width, height) instead of rect(x1, y1, x2, y2)

+ ellipse(x, y, width, height) instead of oval

+ box(size) instead of cube()

+ box(width, height, depth) instead of box(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)

+ sphere(size) stays the same

+ image() instead of imageRect()

+ translate(x, y) in addition to translate(x, y, z)

+ scale(size) and scale(x, y) in addition to scale(x, y, z)

+ rotate(angle) rotates by angle in 2D

+ rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ (angle) each rotate by angle 
  around their respective axes

+ transform( .. 16 floats here .. ) if you think you're matrix math
  genius and wanna play with your own transformations



LESS ANNOYANCE

+ no longer write software backwards! new shapes being drawn actually
replace older shapes, even when using flat, 2D surfaces. 

+ no need to use 'extends KjcProcessingApplet' anymore, just use
'extends ProcessingApplet', and processing will figure out whether
the 'Kjc' part is relevant or not.



PROBABLY NEVER NOTICED

+ colorScale() no longer exists. use colorMode(RGB, ...)
  instead, where ... is whatever you would've put inside colorScale()

+ included run95.bat for people who are using 95/98/ME. you can use
  this .bat if run.bat opens a dos window and closes it quickly
  without starting processing. just put processing at the base of your
  c: drive in a folder called 'processing'.
caution: the beverage you're about to enjoy is extremely hot. this
file is a list of changes between each release. this is not a general
reference of how to use processing, because the information for older
releases will be super crusty.

ABOUT REV 0012 - 29 november 2001,,12,2001-11-29 00:00:00-05:00,"this was a simple fix for a big problem... programs that included
'extends ProcessingApplet' didn't work and gave a cryptic error
message. other than that, no new features.


",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT REV 0013,,13,,"features and tweaks:

- you can set the background color to be used when your applet is
  in full screen mode. in lib/pde.properties change the line
  fullscreen.bgcolor=#0080ff
  to include whatever color you want. the syntax is the same as web
  pages, although you aren't limited to the web palette.

- screenGrab() functionality! get happy.
  add screenGrab() at the end of your loop() function to produce
  a series of numbered tiff-format images that can be imported 
  into a video editing app. or call screenGrab() when the mouse is
  pressed to take quick snapshots. 

- colorcube applet is updated to the current release.
  it is also now included in the sketchbook/examples directory.

- for the technically inclined or curious, the source code for
  ProcessingApplet is included in the sketchbook/standard directory.
  it's not particularly pretty, since it's continually changing, but
  can be useful if you're wondering about how things work.


bugs fixed:

- the fix for rev 12 wasn't actually included in rev 12. grr.
  this implies 1) i'm an idiot, and 2) rev 11 and 12 are the same.

- ellipse was drawing opposite the direction of the origin.

- default program now actually works--replaced colorScale()

- editor was selecting the wrong line for errors.

ABOUT REV 0014 - 10 december 2001,,14,2001-12-10 00:00:00-05:00,"features and tweaks:

- completely flat, unresized images are now significantly faster. this
  affects any time that you use image(img, x, y) and you haven't yet
  used translate/rotate/scale/etc. 

- thin, one pixel lines are much much faster, provided you aren't
  scaling them larger, by say scale(10) or something like that.

- new version of java compiler (kjc) that hopefully sucks less.

- bezierCurve() and catmullRomCurve() have reappeared


bugs fixed:

- way too many OutOfMemoryErrors and maybe that nasty flickery/jumpy
  thing.

- 3D calls to vertex() weren't making things 3D unless a translate or
  a rotate was used


known issues:

- flickery/jumpy thing after the applet runs for a little while. this
  is a bug in sun's java virtual machine (i can't actually program the
  pyrotechnics you're seeing on your screen) but may have resurfaced
  due to low memory conditions because run.bat was screwed up. so the
  problem may be fixed. hopefully. maybe. hmm. 

- i've tweaked a bunch of stuff in this release but haven't had a lot
  of time to test. things look like they're doing much better. but as
  is the case with any release, you can always go back to a previous
  version if the new one gives you too much trouble.

ABOUT REV 0015 - 11 december 2001,,15,2001-12-11 00:00:00-05:00,"known issues:

- this version of processing is even more sketchy than many other
  ones. but maybe it fix two huge issues, so i'm releasing it
  anyways with this caveat. just go back to 14 or another one if this
  gives you too much trouble.


features and tweaks:

- includes a strange hack that fixes the CommPortInUseException that
  had been so annoying, forcing you to restart processing to run your
  apps. the downside is that the fix means that if there's an error in
  your app, you have to check the console (the msdos prompt) for the
  error line, because it won't get highlighted automatically

- switch to the IBM's java virtual machine. it seems stabler than the
  sun one, and sun's stinks because of that nasty screen flickering
  bonanza that starts after you've been running processing for a bit.

ABOUT REV 0017 - 23 january 2002,,17,2002-01-23 00:00:00-05:00,"features and tweaks:

- setFont() now takes a font size

- exporting to applets is slightly less buggy

- hopefully lines are only a single pixel thick when they should be,
  in slightly more cases

- added a 'hint' for smoothing of images and fonts. put
  hint(SMOOTH_IMAGES) in your code to enable smoother text and images,
  but at the risk of things running more slowly. use
  unhint(SMOOTH_IMAGES) to disable.

- millis is a variable that always contains the number of milliseconds
  since your applet started as an int. before it was always zero. use
  it wisely.

- loadImage, loadFont, and getStream are behaving better

- no longer the random exception in graphics that would cause your
  programs to hang due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. haven't
  fixed the bug, but it's at least being caught and worked around.

known issues:

- if you're using 'extends ProcessingApplet' in your code, you'll have
  to use that class name for anything that you export. otherwise incur
  the wrath of a bunch of spew at the dos prompt.

- consistently thin lines are still erratic and not under control

- the line highlighted for any particular error is often a joke

- lots of other things, too numerous to list that make me wonder if
  this will ever be ready to go

ABOUT REV 0044 - 2 september 2002,,44,2002-09-02 00:00:00-04:00,"[ features ] 

- can now use an external program to edit, such as bbedit on the pc or
  emacs on unix. select 'use exteral editor' and the textarea will
  become un-editable. you can then edit with your favorite text
  editor, and the code will be updated in the window each time you hit
  the 'run' button.

- added ability to set foreground and background colors of the
  editor. editor.program.fgcolor and editor.program.bgcolor can be set
  to your favorite color in pde.properties. also the the background
  color indicating 'external editor' is in use can be set via
  editor.program.bgcolor.external.

- more file i/o and data processing capabilities, see changes under
  api additions

- 'beautify' is now enabled, though it may eat all your code in the
  process. if it does, just go back to the previous version by using
  the history menu, and get to the proce55ing website and let us know
  the change of events.

[ api additions ]

- String[] loadStrings(String filename) 
  returns the lines of a file as entries in an array of strings

- byte[] loadBytes(String filename) 
  retrieves a file's contents and places them into a byte array for
  easy processing

- String[] splitStrings(String what) 
  String[] splitStrings(String what, char splitChar) 
  splits a String into several smaller strings wherever there's a
  space. ie. splitStrings(""quick brown fox"") becomes an array with
  elements ""quick"", ""brown"" and ""fox"". the 'splitChar' is optional,
  you can have the line broken up by tabs (if you use '\t') or any
  other character.

- int[] splitInts(String what)
  int[] splitInts(String what, char splitChar)
  same as above, but parses the line as integers

- float[] splitFloats(String what)
  float[] splitFloats(String what, char splitChar)
  you can imagine what this one does

[ api changes ]

- getStream is now loadStream

[ bug fixes ]

- arrow keys now work in a hokey way under macosx. this is better than
  not working at all, but still not great. it's also not really my bug
  fix, but a workaround for apple's bug.

- editor window can now be resized to one's content under osx

- sketch windows won't pop up offscreen anymore.. and if a sketch
  window is too large, it will simply center on-screen.

- names with underscores and other illegal characters weren't being
  restrained. this allowed / and : to be used when renaming/saving
  sketches, which caused the app to blow up.

- console window doesn't die as it approaches 1000 lines of text

- default font size for the editor under macosx is smaller

- major tweak to fix some of the random freezing and crashing that
  occurred when hitting the 'run' button.

- changes to sketch menu: no more CVS and .cvsignore entries and

ABOUT REV 0046 - 20 november 2002,,46,2002-11-20 00:00:00-05:00,"[ major release, new features ]

- now uses a fancy, swing-based text area. things should behave 
  much better for most platforms, particularly on the mac. 

- undo/redo, cut/copy/paste/select all are all supported.

- added 'rename' function, because 'save as' leaves behind
  too many boogers sometimes. this is now the default when clicking
  on the sketch title, instead of 'save as'.

- better error messages for serial port--actul notification if
  the port is unavailable or not properly installed.

- javax.sound is imported by default, so when running inside the
  editor, it's possible to use these classes to play audio files 
  and control midi devices. doesn't work for exporting to applet.

- on windows, sun's xml classes are included as part of the imports,
  so at least from inside the editor, it's possible to use the built
  in xml support from jdk 1.4.

- support for 3D curves in the graphics api. this means new versions
  of curve(), bezier(), curveVertex() and bezierVertex().

- sketch tweaks: naming for sketches is no longer random, but uses the
  date. also, during a run, the window is now named after the current
  sketch.


[ bug fixes ]

- mouse: pmouseX and pmouseY behave more like people expect 
  (they're set at the end of loop() instead of whenever there is 
  new mouse movement)

- macosx: the status bar now resizes with the rest of the 
  window.. this was a workaround for some apple java weirdness.

- fixed more of the issues that cause the random freezes when
  hitting play

- textarea shouldn't spew so many exceptions anymore

- rectangles were drawn one pixel too large


[ a few of the known issues ]

- this release is not available for mac os 9. there were problems
  just before release, and there was no point in holding up the 
  more important platforms for another week.

- download size for windows is getting enormous. in the future will
  switch to having people download and install java 1.4 separately.

- mouse wheel only works on windows, because jdk 1.4 
  is required for mouse wheel, and osx is behind the times.

- it's possible to undo past where it's truly possible, so if you
  undo too many times, your program might disappear. just redo.

ABOUT REV 0047 - 5 january 2003,,47,2003-01-05 00:00:00-05:00,"[ happy new year ]

- hopefully january 2003 will be a good month for p5, as i have
  a short bit of time to work on it and there was a beautiful little
  ibook under the p5 xmas tree to help me with the mac releases. 
  i hope to get a few revisions out this month so i can get back 
  my 'real' work.

[ features ] 

- the text editor has once again been replaced. the new one is fancier
  and less buggy. most obvious thing to note is text coloring. 
  the editor is based on the jedit 'syntax' package. jedit is an
  amazing and feature heavy java-based text editor with an online
  community the size of an organized religion as compared to our
  little p5 cult. see http://www.jedit.org for worship times.

- sketchbook can now be more recursive (folders within folders) than
  it used to be. for those inclined to playing with fire (you're using
  alpha software, so this must be you) you can set the root of your
  sketchbook directory to something besides ""sketchbook"" inside the
  Proce55ing folder. details in the 'readme' doc.

[ bug fixes ]

- a strange crashing after a few weeks of use on the macosx has been
  fixed. it got upset as soon as a .DS_Store file made its way into
  the sketchbook directory. i'd get upset too since those little
  buggers get pooped all over the place as soon as a mac connects to
  anything, but instead some code was written to ignore them. i'm
  trying to learn to ignore them myself. thanks to fdb, brendanberg,
  jes and perhaps others who notified of this one. 

- the undo forever problem has (hopefully) been squashed. in 0046,
  one could undo until the text area went empty, or the previous
  project loaded. if one were to hit undo quickly enough, they might
  have noticed the clock on their wall moving backwards.

ABOUT REV 0048 - 7 january 2003,,48,2003-01-07 00:00:00-05:00,"[ mac os ]

- this release includes a bit of tweaking to the fonts that are used by
  default so that they look nicer on the mac. also, anti-aliasing is
  turned *off* by default (thanks to franklin_mint for the tip), which 
  is a little more appropriate for coding. if you want to re-enable it, 
  check out pde.properties inside 'lib'.

- tried java 1.4 dp8 but it *does not work*, at least not very well,
  with processing. assertion failures or outright crashes. blech. 
  hopefully apple will get this cleaned up and finished soon, because
  it's already running fine under 1.4 on windows.

[ windows ] 

- the release is now split in two, using 'standard' and 'advanced'
  versions. the standard release includes a working java vm, and is
  all set up and ready to go. the advanced version is for people who
  already have java installed (and don't want to deal with the 20MB
  download), and know what they're doing enough that they can also
  install the serial port code by hand. instructions on installing the
  serial code are in the 'serial' folder inside the advanced release.

- wheel mouse works again

- increased the default memory allocation to 64 MB.

[ feature additions ] 

- lots of new examples (some may have issues, see 'known bugs' below)

- code with beauty and grace: new coloring for syntax and the editor,
  fancied up to work more like the p5 site itself. 

- loadImage and loadStream now support http:// URLs (thanks to glen
  for pointing out the omission

- framerate() is a function that always returns the current frame rate
  as a float. 

- framrate(float num) sets the framerate to a specific number. it can
  be used inside setup() or even inside loop(). framerate(0) ressets
  back to the maximum possible framerate.

- new math functions: ceil, floor, and round all work on floats.


[ bug fixes ] 

- attempt has been made to fix the disappearing caret bug. i haven't
  been able to reproduce this on my win2k machine, so i don't know if
  it's fixed.. you'll have to let me know.

- pmouseX and pmouseY are now colored like their siblings mouseX and
  mouseY (thanks benelek)

- pmouseX and pmouseY now get set the very first time mouseX and
  mouseY are set, which might help remove some ""if (firstTime)"" code
  in a couple of projects.

- fixing the print() weirdness uncovered a bug with long lines in the
  console. 


[ between bug and feature ] 

- nicer looking default html for exporting. that old stuff was
  embarrassing. we had hoped it would be too embarrassing for anyone
  to use, but we were wrong. so we've improved the default.

- print() now shows things on the console, even without a println().
  thanks to mike davis and others for pointing this out.

- delay() should no longer slurp up cpu time and make your machine
  flip out. also, it doesn't run on the first time through loop(),
  making things a little smoother. (thanks to glen murphy for the
  report)


[ known bugs ]

- some examples seem to be broken, this will be ironed out for 0050

- a couple tweaks with the syntax of 'color' statements are needed,

ABOUT REV 0052 - 5 march 2003,,52,2003-03-05 00:00:00-05:00,"[ feature additions ] 

- alpha/transparency is partially working.. there are still problems
  (see 'known bugs' section below) but it's in there.

- smooth() and noSmooth() are partially implemented. they've got
  several bugs that we know about but might be fun to play with. we
  know of most of the bugs so we hope to get to them soon.

- fill color can be set for images. IMPORTANT: to get just the image,
  be sure to set the fill to white.

- images no longer cache by default IMPORTANT: if you *want* images to
  cache, you should use loadImage(""filename.jpg"", false). the second
  parameter is whether or not images should be 'forced' to load fresh.

- get the on-screen locations of an xyz point using:
  float sx = screenX(x, y, z); 
  float sy = screenY(x, y, z); 
  float sz = screenZ(x, y, z);

- get the object-space coordinates (how the object is affected by
  translate and rotate etc) using:
  float ox = objectX(x, y, z); 
  float oy = objectY(x, y, z); 
  float oz = objectZ(x, y, z);

- constrain() is now part of the api

- format numbers with nf().. syntax: nf(int num, int digits)
  to make '27' into '0027' -> String formatted = nf(27, 4);

- also for numbers with decimals.. nf(float num, int left, int right)
  to make 27.3 into '027.3000' -> String formatted = nf(27.3, 3, 4);
  or use zero if you don't care the number of digits:
  i.e. make 27.3 into ""27.3000"" -> String fmt = nf(27.3, 0, 4);

- camera functions now work. the following is the code for the
  perspective camera (sorry no more docs, you can check opengl
  references for more info until we get caught up)
  beginCamera();
  cameraMode(CUSTOM);
  perspective(fov, aspect, nearDist, farDist);
  lookat(eyeX, eyeY, eyeDist, eyeX, eyeY, 0, 0, 1, 0);
  endCamera();
  there's also ortho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far) to give you
  an orthographic projection.. frustum() is another useful function in
  this class. these work like their opengl equivalents, but without
  docs are for advanced users only.

- more matrix math.. applyMatrix() takes 16 floats which get
  multiplied by the current transformation matrix. resetMatrix()
  resets the transformation matrix to identity. 

- switched to jre 1.4.1_02 from 1.4.1_01


[ bug fixes ]

- some programs that used 'color' didn't work, now they do.

- fixed other broken examples.

- missing images should no longer lock up the environment. on windows,
  they used to throw an exception and lock everything up.

- color for 'use external editor' works with new scheme.

- numberFormat() had a bug where commas would show up. oops.


[ known bugs ]

- still can't figure out the 'caret disappearing' bug.

- alpha is a little weird (doesn't always work) on lines. it won't
  work on single pixel lines unless smooth() is turned on. 

- smooth() is still imperfect. you may find some jagged edges. text
  marches in a funny way (i.e. typography04). shapes don't always
  properly overlap.

- random freezes under windows, after running a few time. every 20th
  or every 100th time the app just freaks out. use ctrl-alt-del to
  kill the java runtime and restart your app. this will slowly be
  ironed out.

  people were having on windows. text editor is much more usable.

- fixes to non-smoothed images, no longer makes a weird line in the
  center of some images, or leaves out a line of pixels at the end.

- lots of fixes to anti-aliasing, though it's still not anywhere near
  perfect. still suffers most of the problems mentioned below.

LOTS OF NEW CODE, SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THINGS COULD BE VERY BROKEN. 
if you run into trouble, as with any release, just let us know about
the bug on the bboard, and use the previous one that worked for you
(i.e. go back to 54) it's all about 'alpha'.


[ big changes ]

perhaps very exciting, this is the first release to include explicit
support for audio, video, and network. perhaps more exciting is that
this code was developed by developers other than me. 

net and video code was contributed by hernando barragan of ivrea
http://people.interaction-ivrea.it/h.barragan
everyone say ""thanks hernando!""

the audio code is by carlos rocha, a hired gun whose 
employment was made possible by the generous support of ivrea. 
yay carlos! yay ivrea!

more about these guys can be seen at: http://proce55ing.net/info.html


[ status of audio, video, net ]

- audio should be java 1.1 compliant, meaning that it works inside
  applets and on each of the platforms. audio should be working
  reasonably well, and has been tested by carlos a good bit.

- similarly, the net code should be just ducky.

- video input and reading movie files is done through quicktime for
  java, which means that you have to 1) be using windows or macos, and
  2) have the durn thing installed. video is a little bumpy (you may
  find it broken or unusable), which we're ironing out. but the
  problems have been showing up inconsistently, so we preferred to get
  the release out so that y'all can start playing with the other new
  features.


[ new features! new bugs! ]

- sort functions for arrays of ints, floats, doubles or Strings

// here's how it works for floats:
float a[] = { 3.4, 3.6, 2, 0, 7.1 };
sort(a);
for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
  println(a[i]);
}

- added wheel mouse support for osx, when running java 1.4. 
  NOTE! we don't actually recommend using java 1.4 under macosx, as it
  seems to be much less stable than 1.3, and appears to introduce some
  weird inconsistencies when running p5. (this also fixes a bug where
  using a 1.3 vm with the windows expert version would fukker the
  environment).

this isn't everybody, but thanks much to the folks who helped on the
*software* side of this release:

hernando and casey have completed an additional 15 examples covering
topics of video, network, and tangible.  

this is the first release with pre-testers (benelek and mkoser)
checking things out before we accidentally push out a bad
release. also timothy mohn handling the macos9 and macosx packaging
process.

arielm, the bagel papa poule, has been catalogging the graphics engine
bugs and creating tests for each of them. this has helped get more bug
fixes into the graphics engine, more quickly.

toxi has done several fixes and tweaks to the graphics engine, details
listed below.


[ new features (new bugs) ]

- added more words to the syntax coloring

- added a constructor for BImage that takes a java.awt.Image

- added FileInputStream version of loadStream for locally running code

- added screenGrab(String filename). this grabs an uncompressed tiff
  image of the current screen, just like screenGrab(). if "".tif"" isn't
  in the filename, it will be added.

- loadStream/loadBytes work with InputStreams and URLs

- get current stroke/fill/background color with:
  color f = fill();
  color s = stroke();
  color b = background();

- handling of up/down/left/right and control/shift/alt keys, e.g.

  void keyPressed()  
  { 
    if (key == UP) { 
      println(""up""); 
 
    } else if (key == DOWN) { 
      println(""down"") { 
 
    } else { 
      println(""around""); 
    } 
  } 

- link(String urlname) now implemented as a simpler way to get to URLs


[ bug fixes ]

most of these were reported by folks on the bboard. thank you all!
the people who notified us of the bug are in [brackets] though we may
have missed a few.. some of these are reported multiple times..

- transparent gif images now draw properly.. no more workarounds!
  [reported by several people]

- reference now properly unpacks, rather than sitting in the folder
  like a dumb zip file. oops. [mkoser, benelek]

- imageMode issues have been ironed out

- added print(char c) and println(char c) so that they don't just 
  print numbers to the console [benelek]

- fonts were taking up more memory than necessary [arielm]

- added ceil/floor to syntax coloring

- added net stuff to syntax coloring

- fix for points that were drawing invisible (extrusion example was
  broken) [benelek]

- fixed nagging ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on images [benelek]


[ performance ]

- fast 'flat' image drawing has been enabled again and debugged

- fast image drawing then rewritten and debugged again (by toxi)

- last line highlights properly on error (fix by danm)

- code for much faster lines and points (by toxi)

- adaptive circle segment sizing (by toxi)


[ still broken ]

- video and net stuff is still having trouble. this had been priority
  for this release, but has been taking longer than hoped, and we had
  so many fixes that we wanted to push the current rev out.

[ additions ]

- an all-new compiler (jikes) has been wired in by dan mosedale. this
  is super exciting, because of all the compiler trouble we've had in
  the past. thanks to ivrea for providing funding for dan.

- a scrolling, selectable console has been implemented by dan
  haskovec, another of our ivrea-funded hackers.

- context menu cut/copy/paste (right-click in the text area) also
  implemented by dan h.

- saveBytes and saveStrings now implemented (and documented in the
  reference)

- curveMode(int segments) and bezierMode(int segments) now
  implemented. these control the number of line segments used to draw
  a curve. the default has always been 20, but you now have the option
  to set it higher or lower. 

- there's also curveMode(int segments, float squishy) determines the
  squishiness when drawing catmull-rom curves. normally this is set to
  zero, but setting different values will produce more bubbley curves
  that don't necessarily connect all the points. 

- a new function has been added to calculate points along a bezier
  curve, rather than just drawing it. so for the old function:
  bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4); 
  if you wanted to draw 10 segments along it:

  beginShape(LINE_STRIP);
  for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    float t = i / 10.0;  // t should go from 0..1 along the curve
    float x = bezier(x1, x2, x3, x4, t);  // get the x coordinate
    float y = bezier(y1, y2, y3, y4, t);  // get the y coordinate
    vertex(x, y);
  }
  endShape();

  this was also asked for/inquired about in the following bboard posts:

  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1057393989

  the same syntax also works for curve() in addition to bezier().  

- functions have been added to set the cursor, based on code
  contributed by amit pitaru (thanks amit!) usage is in the reference.

- last-used serial port is saved when quitting the environment

- changed more things from ""Proce55ing"" to ""Processing"", since the
  other naming was confusing lots of people. let us know if there are
  parts we've missed.


[ bug fixes ]

- long bezier curves are finally fixed

- got rid of a semi-frequent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when
  smooth() was enabled and images were involved


[ known issues / bugs ] 

- 'export to application' remains unimplemented, though it's closer,
  and should be ready in 58 or 59.

- 'preferences' will get better in a future release

- the noise() functions were added, but don't yet work, they'll be
  fixed for 58.

- macosx hangs randomly, though not consistently enough to figure out
  what's going on.

- on some machines, presentation mode seems to have become unusable,
  this will be fixed in 58.

- the horizontal scroller for the text area has some weirdness, this
  may not be fixed until after beta, depending on how bad it is.

- using screenGrab() or saveBytes() or some of those things will cause
  trouble inside applets. in 58, we'll try to do better error trapping
  so that your applet doesn't crash when this happens.

[ windows ] 

- windows uses java 1.4.2. in general, this is better, except for 
  problems with generating some kinds of audio. if you're having audio
  trouble, then install java 1.4.1, and remove the 'java' folder from
  the processing distribution to use it.

- differences between the 'expert' and normal releases for windows
  have been minimized significantly. as long as you have a jvm
  installed (1.4 strongly preferred), you may as well use the expert
  version. 

- serial port has been improved, and requires no additional
  installation steps, even for the 'exper't release.

- slightly better processing.exe for windows

- background of menus is no longer white, apparently it was a jvm
  problem, and it's fixed in 1.4.2.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1051303115


[ mac os x ]

- macosx updated to use java 1.4. similar to the pc, this is better
  but not always. if you're having trouble, check the instructions in
  readme.txt to see switch it back to 1.3 (which was the default for
  the previous release)

- reference loading and opening the p5 site finally works

- fixed the menus to make them more mac-like. added help menu, removed
  the extra 'quit' menu from 'file', etc. 

- the serial port has been ironed out, and requires no longer requires
  additional installation, although you do need to double-click the
  serial_setup.command script to set up some permissions (unless
  you've installed rxtx 2.1_6 already.. if you don't know what that
  means, run the script). more information in readme.txt. thanks to
  tom igoe for input and heckling to get this to work.


[ mac os 9 ]

- macos9 support is in the freezer until after beta. we still want to
  support macos9, but it was taking too much of our time as we're on a
  strict september deadline for the beta release.


[ phew ]

- that's a lotta stuff

ABOUT REV 0058 - *also* 5 august 2003,,58,,"a handful of fixes because of late-breaking problems with 57. argh!

see the revision 57 release notes for the more useful stuff that's
changed, since it was released the same day.


[ windows ] 

- check to see if quicktime for java is installed, if it isn't, then
  warn the user that it needs to happen.

- moved back to java 1.4.1 so that sound and video work better.


[ macosx ]

- replaced jikes with a version that doesn't require 'fink' to be
  installed.

- use java 1.3.1 as the default, instead of java 1.4. seems that 1.4
  is just not ready for prime time.


[ linux ]

- brought linux java vm up to 1.4.2

- checks to see if jikes is in the PATH, warns if not. this is
  temporary, since jikes isn't properly found.

- testing and notes for new rxtx serial support

few days as we head towards beta.


[ bug fixes ]

- no more ""Class not found"" errors when trying to use an exported
  applet. fixed a supernasty bug that made applets incompatible with
  older versions of java, like the one that everyone uses with
  internet explorer (microsoft's java vm).

- this rev does a better job of finding quicktime for java than the
  last release. quicktime for java search path is not as fragile as it
  was, instead is uses the environment variable QTJAVA, which is set 
  by the quicktime for java installer, should point to a valid
  QTJava.zip. if not, you'll get an error message asking you to
  install/reinstall quicktime.

[ known issues / bugs / if only i had time... ] 

- ""find in reference"" and the reference menu items don't seem to be
  working on some machines. if we can figure out why it works on some
  machines and not on others, we'd like to repair this before beta.

- quicktime for java is still required on windows. it's required on
  macosx too, but it's installed there by default. the requirement
  will be removed in a later release for people who don't want to use
  video, but the fix is more difficult than anticipated, so it will
  probably happen after the initial beta release.

- run.bat hasn't been given love for a while and may not work. at the
  very least, you'll need to modify it to find your copy of quicktime
  for java. 

- expect lots of 'cannot delete somefilename...' messages in red that
  appear when you hit play or stop. these are mostly cosmetic, and
  will be cleaned up in a future release.

- 'export to application' remains unimplemented, though it's closer,
  and should be ready before beta.

- sound doesn't always stop when the 'stop' button is hit (i.e. the
  mixer example seems broken). for now, you have to first quit
  processing to stop it. 

- 'preferences' will get better in a future release

- the noise() functions were added, but don't yet work, they'll be
  fixed soon.

- presentation mode is flickery and unusable, this will be fixed soon.

- the horizontal scroller for the text area has some weirdness, this
  may not be fixed until after beta, depending on how bad it is.

- using screenGrab() or saveBytes() or some of those things will cause
  trouble inside applets. we'll try to do better error trapping soon
  so that your applet doesn't crash when this happens.

ABOUT REV 0060 - 22 september 2003,,60,2003-09-22 00:00:00-04:00,"IMPORTANT NOTE! ACHTUNG!
YOUR OLD CODE WILL PROBABLY BE BROKEN WITH THIS RELEASE.

read the section on api changes very carefully, because a few
functions have been renamed, and the behavior of background() has
changed completely. almost all programs will have to be updated.

but the happy part is that there are many many new features, and this
change to the behavior of background() means lots of positive things.

we decided to make as many of these naming changes as possible all at
once, so that you only have to really mess with your code a single
time. as casey put it, it's better to remove the band-aid quickly.

if you're confused, all the examples have been updated for this
release to use the new function names and background methods. a quick
glance through them should help clear things up.


[ api changes -- read carefully, avoid headaches ]

- noBackground() no longer exists, so remove it from your code.

- background() actually clears the screen immediately, rather than
  simply setting a color. this means that you should use background()
  a the beginning of loop(), if you want your applications to behave
  similar to the way they used to.

- hint(SMOOTH_IMAGES) no longer exists, and is simply the default.
  just remove it from your code. if you get an error saying:
  ""No field named ""SMOOTH_IMAGES"" was found in type ""Temporary_NNNN_NNNN"".
  you should remove the line ""hint(SMOOTH_IMAGES);"" from your program.
  SMOOTH_IMAGES is no longer needed and has been removed.

- fill() no longer colors images. if you want to color images, use
  tint(), which is just like its cousins fill and stroke. like its
  cousins, there's also noTint(), his (her?) contrarian twin.

- getPixel() -> get() and setPixel() -> set()

- get() and set() work directly on BImage objects.

- get(int x, int y, int width, int height) copies a section of pixels
  and puts them in a BImage. (based on code from toxi)

- screenGrab() -> saveFrame()
  saveFrame() will save a sequence of numbered tiff images
  saveFrame(""blah.tif"") will save the current frame as blah.tif
  saveFrame(""blah-####.tif"") will save a sequence of images
    as blah-0000.tif, blah-0001.tif, etc.
  saveFrame(""blah.tga"") will save the current frame as targa.
  saveFrame(""blah-####.tga"") is up to you to figure out.

- strokeWidth() -> strokeWeight()

- bezier(a, b, c, d, t) -> bezierPoint(a, b, c, d, t);
  curve(a, b, c, d, t) -> curvePoint(a, b, c, d, t);

- vertexTexture(u, v) has been rolled into vertex(), so:
  vertex(x, y); vertexTexture(u, v); -> vertex(x, y, u, v);
  vertex(x, y, z); vertexTexture(u, v); -> vertex(x, y, z, u, v);

- vertexNormal() -> normal()

- font.stringWidth(String s) -> font.width(String s)
  font.charWidth(char c) -> font.width(char c)

- removed control key 'F' for 'reference', gave it to 'find'. 
  also set cmd-shift-f as 'find in reference'.


[ additions ] 

- good god, an implementation of find & replace, which means we've
  caught up to 1984.

- BImage.save(String filename) has been implemented. the filename
  should be something and a .tif or .tga at the end to determine how
  the file should be saved.

- background(BImage image); has been implemented, so your background
  can automatically be replaced with an image. note that the image
  must be the same size as your drawing area.

- BImage.copy() returns a copy of an image. better yet, 
  BImage.copy(int width, int height) returns a copy of an image, but
  resized to that specific size. (code contributed by toxi)

- online() returns a true or false for whether an applet is online or
  not. (or really, whether it's running in a proper applet viewer)

- status(String text) shows a string in a browser's status bar, or
  sends it to the console in an application. (this replaces
  Applet.showStatus if you're familiar with that)

- bezierTangent() now implemented, but curveTangent() is unfinished.

- param(String p) reads params from your html code for your applet.

- text(float something, float x, float y) and 
  text(int something, float x, float y) have been implemented.
  just because their syntax is otherwise cumbersome.

- textMode(ALIGN_LEFT), textMode(ALIGN_CENTER), textMode(ALIGN_RIGHT)
  are implemented, and do what you might expect them to.

- clean and pretty two dimensional circles and ellipses have been
  implemented. this will speed and beautify your 2D elliptical needs.

- added several error messages to provide more useful feedback about
  misuse of font api functions or common problems.

- added an error message (instead of failing silently) for when
  noCursor() is attempted in an exported applet.

- BImage.blendMode() has been added, thanks to toxi. details and
  examples are forthcoming. 

- it is now possible to draw inside of setup(). 

- you are no longer restricted to using numbers (rather than
  variables) for size() and background().

- BGraphics now subclasses BImage. if you don't know what that means,
  don't worry about it. just trust me.


[ bug fixes ]

- perlin noise now works, also thanks to toxi.

- single pixel lines finally have alpha and z values. thick lines are
  coming soon. (code from ivrea-funded carlos)

- color() with alpha now works properly

- repaired the function formerly known as screenGrab() so that it is
  far less likely to run out of memory the way it did before. in
  general, if you can get the thing on screen, you should be able to
  save it to disk with the new implementation.

- fixed bug where bezier curves weren't quite straight because of an
  internal rounding error. also fixed another related bug.

- fixed bug where the 'open' button would get stuck if no sketch was
  selected for opening.

- fixed a bug where the caret would show up even though processing
  processing's window was not active.

- removed ugly white borders around gui elements that show up on
  macosx (workaround for a bug in apple's java 1.3 implementation).

- removed an extra push() and pop() in the text(), which may speed
  things up a bit.

- we've silenced the ""couldn't delete..."" messages


[ known problems, pardon our dust ]

- macosx doesn't provide an option to 'cancel' when it so politely asks
  if you want to ""save changes before quitting?"". this is because of
  weirdness in apple's java that we're trying to straighten out.

- lines with stroke weights that aren't 1 are probably broken.

- single pixel lines still have some problems with drawing over things.

- the size of exported applets has jumped in this release. this will
  get smaller again in a future release. we're in the middle of
  transitioning between two different sets of rendering/graphics code.

- clipping planes are not yet implemented. meaning that objects may
  sometimes fly into the camera and turn upside down or do other tricks.

  polygons won't draw properly.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062469819;start=0

- jikes is ~9 megabytes in size, which is a bit obnoxious. it doesn't
  hurt anything but we plan to put it on a diet for a future release.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062581723

- curveTangent() is not yet implemented. contributions welcome.

- strokeMiter() and strokeJoin() exist but are not implemented.

- textures warp in strange ways due to perspective problems.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1050650262

- smooth() is not completely implemented. there will be quirks in how
  it draws (like a weird flat line at the end of a shape, or areas
  that are less than smooth).

- on windows, processing can't be run from a folder that has non-ascii
  characters in its name. 
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062794781

- video examples sometimes crash the whole environment on windows

- net needs work, it's currently sending unicode, instead of ascii or
  UTF-8, data. this can cause problems with other programs.

ABOUT REV 0061 - 23 september 2003,,61,2003-09-23 00:00:00-04:00,"this is a brief addendum release to revision 60, that fixes a few
small things. if you've downloaded 60, this isn't necessarily a
""must-have"", but it fixes a few quirks that showed up in the final
stages of rev 60.

if you used a previous version of processing, and haven't yet tried
60, then please read its release notes, as many things have changed.


[ bug fixes ]

- fixed a handful of examples that were broken in rev 60.

- modifications to the sound code that prevented it from running with
  the microsoft java 1.1 vm.

- removed ""width 200 high 200"" message that showed up during export.

- fixed IllegalAccessError that showed up in applets that had inner
  classes, when run inside the ancient microsoft java vm. 

- brightened the red color used for error messages in the console,
  since some found it hard to read. also note that you can always set
  this color yourself by editing the pde.properties file that is found
  inside the 'lib' folder.

- fixed saveFrame() to allow for just ""blah.tif"", as was stated in
  this document for rev 60.

- removing .DS_Store files from the windows release


[ additions ] 

- if no reference is found for ""found in reference"", p5 provides a
  message rather than doing nothing.


[ known problems ]

- a complete list of known problems can be found in the revisions.txt
  entry for release 60.

- a lot of println() commands will make the environment really slow or
  even lock up completely. it's because the console can't keep
  up. we're working on a fix.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064182823



[ common problems, not actually bugs ]

- names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
  inside. this is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
  java classes. i suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)

ABOUT REV 0062 - 24 september 2003,,62,2003-09-24 00:00:00-04:00,"this release primarily introduces new features. it is the third
release in three days, as i'm pushing to get features out and
available rather than getting held up in a long release like some of
the others have been. this pace of releases will not continue, and is
only happening while i have time to work on the environment.

releases 61 and 62 are suggested downloads, since they fix minor bugs
or add features, as opposed to a more strongly recommended update like
revision 60.

people who haven't used 60 yet should refer to its release notes for
changes that you'll need to make to your programs in order to work in
releases 60 and later.


[ changes & additions ] 

- ""add files"" menu command as a simpler way to add files to your
  sketch folder than navigating through the explorer.

- a built-in font creator has been added, available from the sketch
  menu. this tool will allow you to create your own fonts, and add
  them directly to your sketch. you can also use 'add files' to add
  fonts from the 'fonts' folder. however, the fonts folder will be
  removed in a future release. 

- no more digging for sketches.. ""show sketch folder"" opens up the
  folder of the current sketch using the finder on the mac or the
  windows explorer on windows. 

- after exporting a sketch, automatically open the applet folder that
  was just created.

- some modification to the menu layouts, i.e. ""clear history"" is now
  part of the history menu itself.

- switched back to a more red color for errors in the console. 
  the yellow was an accident. but again, it's editable in 'lib' ->
  pde.properties if you liked the yellow or want something else.


[ bug fixes ] 

- finally found the problem with showing reference on macosx and fixed
  it. this had eluded me for a while since it was working ok on my own
  machine, but thanks to timothy mohn for harrassing me into fixing it.


[ known problems ]

- have been moved to the 'bugs.txt' file. check there for the status
  of your favorite bug/feature.

ABOUT REV 0063 - 27 september 2003,,63,2003-09-27 00:00:00-04:00,"revision 63 includes some major new features and semi-major bug fixes,
however it has not been tested very thoroughly. 

like 61 and 62, this is a suggested download (for people who have at
least revision 60). if you're running a version older than 60, then
this version is strongly recommended.

if you used a version of processing older than 60, and have not yet
tried revision 60 or later, then you should read the section of
revisions.txt that talks about all of the many changes that happened
in revision 60.


[ additions ]

- this release is the first to add the ability to load external .class
  and .jar files to your projects. it is also the first revision to
  support the full 'java' mode as described in the documentation. in
  order to use this mode, you'll need to have java somewhere in your
  path. this will change in future releases.

- when using 'add files' and selecting a .class, .jar, or shared
  library file, the files will be copied to the 'code' folder for
  inclusion in your sketch, instead of the 'data' folder.


[ bug fixes ] 

- on windows 2000, some applets were running very very slowly half 
  the time. arielm spent hours tracking down the problem caused by a
  single one line change, so win2k users (and i) have him to thank.

- fixed problem where the serial port menu on windows was always
  dimmed, unless processing was started using the .bat files. so
  serial port should work again.

- beautify menu was broken (it did nothing) and has been repaired.

in total may seem like nothing at all. they're all specific fixes for
people that piped up about something 

this is another mini-release like 61, 62, and 63. it's a suggested
download, but not as huge as revision 60. 


[ bug fixes ]

- thick lines, which disappeared in rev 60, have returned triumphant
  due to a nudge from ed.

- fixed a bug on macosx, especially with safari, that caused the
  environment to complain about an ""unexpected char"" when pasting code

- removed the 'cancel' option from ""save changes before quitting?"" on
  windows, since it seems to not always work, causing destruction of
  code and sadness. specifically, it ate bijeoma's code:

- the font builder now sets a default filename when selecting a font,
  since axel was annoyed that it didn't have a default.

up starting with rev 60. and some other tiny tidbits.


[ bug fixes ] 

- fonts have been return to their previous state, fixing some real
  ugliness that appeared starting with release 60.

- beautify does a better job of retaining the caret position, rather
  than jumping back to the beginning of your code. it's not perfect
  yet, but perfection will happen post-beta.

lots of things have been repaired, though this release hasn't been
heavily tested, which might necessitate a 67 sometime later this week.

mode, or external libraries (like amit's jsyn stuff), or of medium
importance for everyone else.


[ bug fixes ]

- set the correct version number for the about dialog. also added code
  to prevent the wrong release number from being used on a release.

  the scenes. fixes a couple issues where code wouldn't compile.

- save/saveFrame was super-slow, especially on macosx, where times for
  a 640x480 image could easily approach a full minute. things have
  been sped up way more better.

  thing in a program. now fixed.

[ bug fixes for java mode ]

- native libraries (.dll, .jnilib, or .so files) can be dropped
  into the 'code' folder of your sketch. this didn't work in the past,
  but is now much simpler. 

- println() wasn't working properly from java mode classes, and
  sometimes caused applications to die. no more.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067218548;start=0

- you no longer need to have java installed (i.e. the expert version)
  to use java mode. so the following entry has been removed from
  bugs.txt: ""java mode in rev 63 and higher only works if you have
  java available in your path--meaning that you've installed it
  yourself under windows or linux, or this will always be the case 
  for macosx.""

- fixed a problem with multiple jar files

  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067135162;start=0

- on compiler errors, instead of the message saying ""send to
  bugs@proce55ing.net"" instead it asks to use the discourse section of
  the site, and automatically opens that page in a web browser.

- netscape.javascript is now included in the lib/ folder. seems that
  not all jvm distributions include it, so just easier to include our
  own copy.

ABOUT REV 0068 - 2 february 2004,,68,2004-02-02 00:00:00-05:00,"this is a bug fix release, not the planned version of 68 that supports 
multiple files and all sorts of amazing magic. it will be the last release 
for the next two months while ben finishes his dissertation. 


[ bug fixes ]

- concave/convex polygons are now handled properly. just don't make
  the last point of the polygon be the same as the first, otherwise
  you'll confuse the tesselator. however! there is a bug (that showed
  up during the release process.. ugh) that when smoothing is enabled,
  sometimes thin lines will be visible within a concave polygon. this
  will just have to be fixed in a future release. however, as long as 
  stroke() is enabled on the polygon, the lines should not be visible.

- fixed a bug that made the p5 environment freeze when an applet crashed

- fixed problem with the environment locking up when the console got
  too full. the console now has a maximum number of lines, set to 500 
  by default. the console is also cleared on each run, so that doesn't 
  cause trouble anymore. you can change both settings in pde.properties.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1075759355

- font builder should update when the size for the font is changed
  (so long as the size itself is valid)

- font builder bug, was cutting off parts of letters

- better loadStream support when bagel is used by itself


[ features ] 

- added support for non-ascii characters in the font builder

ABOUT REV 0069 - 28 march 2004,,69,2004-03-28 00:00:00-05:00,"this is yet another bug fix release, which repairs several things, 
mostly things that i've run into over the past few as i've been doing
a lot of coding with processing, and some things that were really
causing trouble for folks on the board. basically i was bummed out to
see bug reports on things that i had fixed, or could fix semi-easily.

i'm not releasing linux for this one for lack of time. it will also
not be listed (at least not initially) as the default download on the
page, since it hasn't been tested heavily: this release might not be
particularly stable, i threw it together because i've been working
with p5 a lot lately and had several fixes, but didn't have the time
to do the usual ""vetting"" process with the testers. if you have any
weird problems, just use 0068.

it's likely that a handful of the examples are also broken because of
the api changes.. my apologies.. 

there will likely be a couple more releases before the ""big"" 
release that i still need a better name for than ""the big release"".
suggestions are welcome.

[ api changes & additions ] 

- loadStream() has become openStream(), for better consistency. 

- toInt(), toFloat(), to String() functions.. 
  ** the naming of these are subject to change..     **
  ** we haven't decided on a proper naming for them! **

- splitStrings() becomes just split().. splitInts() goes away. 
  splitInts becomes -> toInt(split(someString, ','));

- split() now handles multiple chars, i.e. 
  split(someString, "", "") will split on any number of comma or space
  chars in between (sort of a regexp but not really).
  to split on commas and any amount of whitespace between, use:
  split(someString, "","" + WHITESPACE);

- WHITESPACE is a String constant that includes the normal whitespace
  chars (space, tab, linefeed, carriage return, etc) plus the unicode
  ""non breaking space"" char.

- chop() function that also handles the unicode non-breaking space
  character (found commonly on the mac)

- text(x, y, z) instead of just text(x, y)

- printMatrix() and printCamera() print the current (object space)
  transformation matrix and the camera (perspective) matrix. 

- nf() and nfs() now work on whole arrays of numbers

- nfp() is like nfs() but shows a plus sign instead of a space

- code from toxi to support .tga files in loadImage()
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1078459847;start=0

- bagel code is getting less 1.1 vs. 1.3 specific, thanks to additions
  from jonathan feinberg.

ABOUT REV 0070 - MEGABUCKET - 29 September 2004,,70,,"YOUR CODE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BREAK IN THIS RELEASE, READ THE
""MAJOR CHANGES"" SECTION BELOW TO SEE HOW TO FIX IT. this is one of the
most major releases to date in terms of things that have been changed,
fixed, or revised. unfortunately, there will still be api changes
before beta. if you don't want to deal with your code breaking, then
wait until the beta. 

as of this release, we're also returning to more truly ""alpha"" status
for releases. from 70 until beta, releases will happen more frequently
(hopefully) and increment more quickly. however, we won't be
announcing a new release to the greater public until beta, at which
time we'll be done breaking everyone's code. more details here:
http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Collaboration;action=display;num=1096489132


major changes: (things that break your code) 

- if you have a program that uses ""void draw()"" to draw a static
  image, you need to add the line ""noLoop()"" to setup or to the first
  line of the draw method itself.

- for any programs that use ""void loop()"" you need to change its name
  to ""void draw()"". 

- BImage, BFont, BGraphics, etc are all PImage, PFont, PGraphics.
  you'll need to rename them in your program.

- libraries will almost certainly need to be rewritten for this
  release. we're working with amit on an update to sonia and several
  other libraries will be included in future releases.

- mouse and key events are now properly queued, meaning that functions
  like mousePressed() and keyPressed() will be called at the *end* of
  your draw() method. this means that you can ""draw"" inside of those
  methods, just note that it'll happen after all other drawing.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1079555200;start=0

- CENTER_DIAMETER has become CENTER

- replicate() in PImage is now called copy(). other changes in PImage
  as well, see the ref: http://processing.org/reference/PImage.html

- curveSegments and bezierSegments are now called curveDetail and 
  bezierDetail.

- net, serial, and video are completely different. see the libraries
  reference: http://processing.org/reference/libraries/index.html
  their examples have also been updated.

- quicktime is no longer required to be installed on windows

- the 'fonts' folder has been removed. these were old (had no special
  characters like umlauts and whatnot) and of questionable copyright
  status, so we took them out. you can create fonts to your heart's
  content using the ""Create Font"" option.

- history has been (temporarily?) removed. in the meantime under the
  ""Tools"" menu is an option named ""Archive Sketch"" which will zip up
  the contents of the current sketch folder into a numbered archive.
  the numbers will automatically increment yoursketch-001.zip,
  yoursketch-002.zip etc.

- key events for things like arrow and whatnot should use 'keyCode'
  instead of 'key'. so 
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096304533;start=0
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096304779;start=0

- the sizing/spacing of text() has changed! a combination of small
  bugs inside text() and the ""Create Font"" tool meant that text was
  not sized properly. it's now been tweaked to more closely resemble
  the sizing used by the platform. for  instance, 48 point type of a
  font in illustrator looks like 48 point type of the same font in
  processing. 


additions: 

- hex(), binary(), unhex(), and unbinary() functions to make your
  geeky debugging sessions that much happier. 
  color c = #ffcc00;
  println(hex(c));

- support for text in a box: text(String text, x, y, width, height);
  this is like the text box in adobe illustrator or programs like 
  that, note that the x, y where it starts will be the top of the
  line of text, not the baseline of the text as is the case for
  the other text() functions.

- operators for int(), string(), char(), and other basic types.
  String s = ""10.2"";
  float f = float(s);
  making it simpler to do conversions between types.

- these operators also work on arrays:
  String s[] = { ""10.2"", ""3.2"" };
  float f[] = float(s);

- looping can be turned on/off via loop() and noLoop(). the default is
  that loop() is in use. there's also a redraw() function that you can
  use in noLoop() mode which lets you redraw the screen once (i.e. if
  you want to update after a mouse event)

- multiple files! you can create new tabs that store separate classes
  and pieces of code. how happy. however, the tabs are only separators
  for your code.. the code is all still added to the main class (the
  first tab) the same way as if the code had appeared all jammed into
  that first file. 

- for advanced users, additional tabs can be java files, which, unlike
  the tabs described above, will *not* be embedded into the main
  applet class. to create  a java file, include "".java"" at the end of
  the new file's name when creating the new tab. also note, however,
  that the java files will not go through the preprocessor, meaning
  that 0.1 will have to be 0.1f if it's a float, and some other
  tidbits like that.

- the ""examples"" folder for sketches is read-only. ""save as"" of an
  example won't save it inside the examples folder.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096295037;start=0

- read-only sketches (i.e. from a CDROM) are now handled properly.

- you can save sketches anywhere you want. and there's a preferences
  dialog that lets you set the location of your sketchbook. that
  annoying ""sketchbook/default"" thing is no more. in preferences, 
  you can also set whether processing should ask your for the file
  location & name for each new sketch, or if you just want the old
  behavior (automatically created sketch named sketch_yymmdd).
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096295141;start=0

- holding down 'shift' and hitting the 'new' button will do the
  opposite behavior for ""new sketch"" (i.e. if ""prompt for sketch name""
  is selected in preferences, it won't prompt, and vice versa).

- preferences and sketchbook are now stored in: 
  macosx: /Users / yourusername / Documents / Processing
  windows: Documents and Settings / yourusername / My Documents / Processing
  linux: home directory -> .processing 
  you can change the sketchbook location, but this folder will
  continue to be used to store preferences.txt and other files that
  may be needed in the future.

- a default template can be used for exporting applets. copy
  applet.html from processing's ""lib"" folder to your sketch's folder,
  and modify it to your heart's content. each time you re-export, your
  html file will be used instead of the standard one.

  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096297787;start=0

- javascript support is now handled by saying
  ""Import Library -> javascript""

- for advanced users, what was formerly called 'bagel' is now in
  package processing.core. we'll refer to this as ""core"", and the
  files can be found in lib/core.jar of the processing folder. no more
  pde.jar and separate extraction methods for 1.1 code and 1.3 code to
  be used with other IDEs.


minor additions:

- tweaked up the menus. the ""Tools"" menu will be user-expandable in a
  future release. 

- added some better error messages for common compiler errors.

- sketches with a large 'data' folder will run better
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096300630;start=0

- added a preference for auto-cleaning the sketchbook.

- the console is emptied each time a new sketch is opened.

- PImage.filter(GRAYSCALE) will make an image grayscale. 
  PImage.filter(BLACK_WHITE) does something else fascinating.

- hint(NO_DEPTH_TEST) will disable the zbuffer (unhint will re-enable)
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096303102;start=0

- printarr() works like println() for arrays.. it just prints out a
  long list of the array contents.

- added a lerp() function
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1083289030;start=0

- added angleMode(DEGREES) and angleMode(RADIANS)
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096303599;start=0

- noiseSeed and randomSeed help make random() less random.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096304206;start=0

- added a boolean variable called 'focused' that is set to true when
  your applet has focus. use this to tell the user ""click inside the
  applet"" or whatever.

- saveFrame no longer dies when it includes folder names. it also
  saves to the sketch folder.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096303714;start=0

- inputFile() returns a File object after prompting the
  user. outputFile does the same after asking ""save as...""

- for those dismayed by things flying into the camera.. we regret that
  this release still does not properly implement clipping planes. in
  the meantime, an option has been added to avoid some of the mess. 
  it's incomplete and doesn't always work, but adding
  hint(NO_FLYING_POO) to your code might improve the situation. 

- savePath(String filename) returns the full path name for a file to
  be saved relative to the sketch directory. createPath(File dir) will

ABOUT REV 0071 ,,71,,"bug fix release, clears up several things with text and other tidbits 
found by all y'all beta testers. if this is your first release 
since 68 or 69, you should read about the changes made in rev 70.


BUG FIXES

- suppress ""bad file descriptor"" error on mac os x

- properly alphabetize the sketch menu (ignore upper/lower case)

- fixed export on macosx

- multiple tabs no longer causes things to run in another java vm.
  (unless the other tabs are for .java files)

- dim 'rename' on the first tab, since it cannot be renamed.

- ""save as"" now properly updates the tabs

- don't let people ""save as"" a sketch inside itself.

- removed the resize box for applets (since they can't be resized anyway)

- cursor() functions are now usable (public) again

- pre, post & draw now work with libraries


CHANGES

- the 'key' variable has been made into a char, so that things like 
  println(key) makes more sense (and in keeping with java's getKeyChar)

- added a little gap to the left of the editor frame
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1097363967;start=0

- changed ""new file"" to ""new tab"" for clarity

- ""add file"" of a .pde or .java file already inside the sketch folder
  no longer produces an error, it just updates the tabs.

- ""save as"" defaults to the current sketch location and name

- text(x, y, w, h) now uses the current rectMode() for placement. 

- align left, center, and right are now properly implemented for text().

- PFont2 has been merged back into PFont. java 1.2+ specific features 
  that had been sequestered to PFont2 are now handled through reflection.


CHANGES I FORGOT TO MENTION FOR REV 70

- 'online' is now a boolean instead of a function that returns a
  boolean. this was actually in 0070 but i forgot to mention it

- also from 70, people who used triangle_count, it's now called
  triangleCount.

ABOUT REV 0072,,72,,"bug fix release, most major being that the code folder should now be
working again, and error messages from libraries may have an easier
time of propogating upwards.

BUGS

- code folder works again.

- the code folder hanging bug *may* have been fixed.. either by a fix
  from francis li, or by the error message changes by me. keep your
  fingers crossed.. 

- loadImage() is broken on some machines.. a small hack has been
  introduced to get around this, hopefully it doesn't break for
  everyone else. as a result of the hack, the 'cache' setting on
  images is temporarily ignored.

- hint()/unhint() settings were static variables, meaning that they'd
  stick around per processing session, which is too long. 


API & STUFF

- g.m00, g.m01 etc are now public

- error message shows up when a library isn't available


",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT REV 0073,,73,,"fixes to several nastier bugs (hopefully) 

- the hanging bug may be fixed in this release

- loadImage() should no longer re-download the entire jar file

- libraries are built as 1.1 code like everything else, so things with
  particles can be exported again

- fixed a minor bug that prevented non-smoothed fonts from being 
  created in the font builder on macosx due to apple's creativity 
  with the java spec

ABOUT REV 0074,,74,,"- fixed an issue with text and shapes fixing in a bad way (paul
  fishwick's 'clock' bug)

- removed a zbuffer precision hack that was drawing lines above
  everything else

- includes new icons designed by florian

ABOUT REV 0075,,75,,"* DON'T USE THIS RELEASE IF YOU'RE ON ANY SORT OF MEDICATION *
this is truly an alpha release, or more like a ""nightly build.""

i'm posting this release early so that people can play with
opengl. if you aren't one of those just *dying* to get started with
gl, wait until a few days or so when i can get 0076 out that irons out
some of the nastier bugs. you needn't post bug reports on things that
are broken, since i know many many things are horked. a massive number
of changes have happened in this release and i wanted to get it posted
because i was starting to lose track of them all.


things that i know or suspect are broken: 

- the examples have not been updated

- windows sometimes pop up at the wrong sizes.

- opengl doesn't behave properly in static/draw mode (things aren't
  sized properly).

- the processing renderer has taken some steps backwards, and things
  like ellipses might be broken.

- lots of random tidbits in rendering not quite working. 

- drawing images in opengl whose pixel buffer has been edited won't
  work quite right.

- text may pop up sized incorrectly.

- noLoop(), framerate(n), redraw() are not yet supported for opengl

- and much much more!


general 

- you now need to use the command depth() to enable 3D. noDepth()
  shuts it off and moves back to 2D-only (with optimizations). support
  for this is incomplete. 

- hanging bug should now be completely eliminated.

- under sketch, a ""renderer"" menu that lets you select OpenGL or the
  processing renderer. 

- preprocessor makes all methods ""public"" that aren't specified
  private or protected. this makes things easier for library events
  (see libraries section below) and things like setup/draw.


core

- added focusGained() and focusLost() events

- added beginShape(TRIANGLE_FAN)

- removed pmouseX and pmouseY because they can't be used 


libraries

- very simple sound api has returned. command is ""loadSound"". 1.3+ only
  for rev 75, will work in 1.1 as well in 76+.

- serial.last() and serial.lastChar() get last byte in buffer

- library events have returned, if (public) void serialEvent(PSerial)
  is defined in the host applet, it will receive events each time
  something happens on serial. same for:
  cameraEvent(Camera c), movieEvent(Movie m), clientEvent(Client c), 
  serverEvent(Server s, Client c), soundEvent(PSound s)

- PMovie.length() is now PMovie.duration()


ide goodness

- NOTE! your prefs will be lost in this release, unless you move them
  by hand. preferences now live in a ""proper"" location: 
  ~/Library/Processing on macosx and 
  Documents and Settings/username/Application Data/Processing on winxp
  this will get rid of the localization issues on non-US versions of
  these operation systems. 
  the info is read from the os (on mac) and registry keys (on
  windows), and is also used to place the Processing sketchbook inside
  ~/Documents on mac or ~/My Documents (or whatever it's called in the
  current language) on the pc.

- rename & delete have returned.. when renaming/deleting on the
  first tab, it renames or deletes the entire sketch.

- saving a read-only sketch now defaults to the sketchbook
  (rather than the same read-only location it was coming from)

- build fixes.. preproc gets built properly, and dmg for osx

- cosmetic (single pixel layout issues) fixed on osx

- no more resize box annoyance in the editor on osx

- fixes to the horizontal scrollbar in the editor 
  (became ever-present a release or two ago)

- find/replace cleaned up/tweaked up a bit

ABOUT REV 0076,,76,,"this was a quick release that fixed launcher issues on both mac os x

part of the third quarter of the super bowl, but you guys are just

ABOUT REV 0077 - 1 March 2005,,77,2005-03-01 00:00:00-05:00,"* PLEASE READ THIS INFORMATION BEFORE POSTING TO THE BETA LIST *

this is another release where processing has undergone massive
changes. hopefully it is hopefully more stable than 75 and 76, 
and i'm ready to take bug reports again.


changes/important notes:

- whenever you use 3D in this release, you must use the depth() command
  inside of setup (preferably just before or after size()). having
  tried to keep the 2D rendering together, it's just become too messy
  and error prone to continue. 

- after editing the pixels[] of an image, you must use the new method
  updatePixels(). this became necessary because of the Java 2D
  renderer as well as OpenGL. it's unfortunate, but it's all we can
  do. so after messing with pixels[] for the main surface, or doing
  the same with an image, call updatePixels() to mark the entire image
  as modified, or call updatePixels(x, y, w, h) to update just a
  portion (this is currently no faster, but later will represent an
  optimization). 

- you'll also need to use loadPixels() on any PGraphics object 
  before reading its pixels and messing with its pixels[] buffer.

- using size() with actual numbers, as opposed to variables, is
  strongly recommended. there's no reason to use size(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
  because the variables width & height can be used for the same
  purpose after size() has been called. this helps the ""export""
  command and also becomes very important with opengl.

- rendering... this release represents a significant change to how
  rendering is handled. all of the graphics has been split into
  multiple classes, which are: 

  PGraphics     2D rendering with Java 1.1 
                this is the old renderer, but it has been semi-disabled
                in the current release. this means that things won't 
                draw properly (or at all) in 2D in most web browsers 
                (where the java plugin is not installed). this renderer
                will no longer support smooth() and noSmooth().

  PGraphics2    2D rendering for systems using Java 1.3+ 
                this is used dynamically whenever the applet detects
                that it is running on a Java 1.3+ system. 
                it is an entirely new, and *complete* renderer based
                on Java2D. this was a shortcut to get a renderer that
                worked properly on the vast majority of machines in
                our target audience (courses, beginners, developers) 
                until i have time to complete the 1.1 renderer (so
                that exporting to the web works again). basically, 
                i've sold out, in hope of ever reaching 1.0.

  PGraphics3    3D rendering in Java 1.1
                this is loaded when the depth() command is executed
                inside of setup(). any applet requiring 3D must now
                explicitly state depth() inside setup(). the renderer
                is composed of the 3D components from the old
                renderer, although it's using sumea sami's newer
                triangle rendering, meaning that things are much
                faster than before (although textures are a little
                fuggly). there are no plans to support smooth() in 
                this mode. for smoothing, use the OpenGL renderer.
                stroke caps/joins will also probably not work in this 
                mode (lines are 2D objects, how do you put a stroke
                on a 3D object?), but that hasn't yet been fully
                determined.

  PGraphicsGL   OpenGL renderer for use in Java 1.3+ 
                jogl requires java 1.3, and this rendering option can
                just be selected from a menu. this handles both 2D
                and 3D and will actually ignore the depth() command
                (though you should still use it with opengl apps for
                good practice). 

  PMethods      an interface for plug-in file-based renderers.
                for instance, to write a postscript renderer, one
                need only implement the ""PMethods"" interface with
                your class. then, at the beginning of draw(), use:
                recordFrame(psRenderer);
                which will echo all rendering calls to that
                class until the end of the frame. this handles
                writing to files, we won't be supporting plug-in
                visual renderers in Processing 1.0 (unless you want
                to use this to open up a separate window or something
                weird like that)

  if you're curious, or filing a bug report, you can always check what
  the current rendering engine is by using: println(g.getClass());

- very exciting: strokeWeight(), strokeCap(), strokeJoin() et al 
  now work when using 2D and using Java 1.3 or higher. these will 
  eventually work in Java 1.1 for 2D as well. 

- the new renderers may change the speed of some things significantly. 
  for instance, using text on java 1.3 when depth() hasn't been called
  (PGraphics2) may be far slower than before. or using images in the same
  situation may require much more RAM. on the other hand, smoothed shapes
  and general drawing in the same situation might be much faster.

- i'm trying to think of a means to switch between the java 1.3 version 
  of the 2D api and the 1.1 version in case people want to force use of
  the old one (once it's working again). we'll see.

- presumably the separation of the rendering engines also means that
  one could post a web applet that doesn't include the 3D rendering
  code if your applet is only 2D (or vice versa).

- pmouseX and pmouseY have returned and are better than ever.

- firstMouse boolean variable added, which is set 'true' when the
  mouse gets its first legitimate mouse coordinate. naming for this
  var will likely change in a future release.

- arc() command has been added. it's just like ellipse:
  arc(x, y, w, h, start, stop); 
  and uses ellipseMode() for its placement.

- circle() has been removed. it was a dumb duplication with ellipse().
  it's not as though we have a square() function to go with rect().

- because of the separation of the 2D and 3D renderers, it should be
  possible to create much larger PGraphics objects and for them to use
  far less memory than before. 

- light() commands work, though things seem to look super ugly by
  default. they're more correct when using OpenGL, and perhaps if
  placed more explicitly, you may get better results.

- the alpha() command that sets the alpha mask is now called
  mask(). this is to avoid the name clash with the red(), green(), 
  blue(), alpha() functions. 

- imageMode(CORNER) and CORNERS are the only valid image modes. 
  imageMode affects get(), copy(), blend(), etc so it was just too
  weird to have the CENTER functions operating in that mode. results
  would have been very strange and unexpected.

- box() and sphere() should be working again with opengl

- die() is a newish internal function that's used whenever exceptions 
  or internal errors occur. you can make your own error handler by
  overriding die(String s) and die(String s, Exception e) if you'd
  like your applet to do something smarter than just halting. we're
  moving to where exceptions and errors are handled in a more
  consistent way, and that no p5 methods will require try and catch
  style exception handling (for advanced users who want it, they can
  use the java equivalents of the various PApplet methods). 


ide fun

- forgot to mention in rev 75 that double-clicking a .pde file on the
  mac will now launch processing with that sketch. someday windows will
  do this too. someday...

- i've replaced the cvs version of jikes that we'd been using with
  jikes 1.22, a real release, and the very latest. it's only 2 or 3MB
  (instead of 8 or 9MB) and crashes much less. yay! the reason we can
  make the switch is that 1.22 supports -target 1.1 again (it had
  disappeared in some of the previous releases, and it's absolutely
  essential for p5).


serial library

- serialEvents are now fired after each byte has been received. 

- added buffer(int count) method to Serial to set the number of
  bytes to receive before firing a serialEvent.

- added bufferUntil(int whatByte) method to Serial that will buffer 
  until that byte has been received and then call serialEvent().

- these changes were simple code but haven't been tested, so they
  may be prone to errors. let me know.

- just one function (prompt() which will bring up a list of serial 
  ports in a nice window) remains to finish the Serial library, 
  everything else is considered complete (barring a revolt by the 
  itp physical computing guys). 


known bugs

- the examples have not been updated. they're getting pretty crufty, 
  but i've been making such a mess of the api that i've made casey
  hold off until things settle down a bit before updating.

- curveVertex() is temporarily broken in this release.

- export to web is temporarily broken in this release for machines
  that don't have the java plug-in installed. this includes 60% of
  Windows users on the web, and anyone using Mac OS 8 or 9. the applet
  will export, but will turn up mostly blank on machines with Java 1.1.
  to publish things to the web, you might want to use an earlier
  release, or force people to upgrade their java vm somehow.

- windows coming up at the wrong size or with the wrong placement:
  make sure you're using size(nnn, nnn) where nnn are actual
  numbers. if you're doing that and still seeing trouble, please
  report how to reproduce.

- on macosx (maybe windows too?) applets sometimes come up with their
  top 20 pixels or so missing. working on a fix.

- when using opengl, the ""Using ATI workaround..."" error message isn't 
  really an error, it's just something that jogl spits out. fret not.
  same with that ""can't get focus"" error that often shows up on the
  mac. i don't think there's anything i can do about either.

- lighting is fuggly. i have a feeling that normals aren't being set
  up properly, partly because that code has gotten no love for a long
  time and everything around it has changed.

- several reported ide bugs with ""save as"", ""hide"" and others remain. 
  i hope to fix these in the next release.

- tint() does not work properly in depth() mode and using the 
  processing renderer (PGraphics3).

ABOUT REV 0078 - 30 March 2005,,78,2005-03-30 00:00:00-05:00,"this release includes a large number of fixes for the 2D graphics engine. 
nothing has changed in the processing 3D engine (what you get when you 
call depth()), however the OpenGL renderer now supports loadPixels(), 
updatePixels(), saveFrame(), get(), and pmouseX/Y.

around the corner are big fixes to 3D when simon finishes the new 
lighting model. he's moving through it pretty quickly so we hope to have
it in a release shortly.


major things still not solved since last release:

- still lots of threading/flickering strangeness

- applet not being placed properly inside its window

- things sometims not starting up (gives a cryptic error in the console)

- text inside a rect is slightly broken

- you can't do per-vertex coloring of lines in 2D

- everything else not covered here that was broken in 77...


api changes:

- fun things: some of the filter() stuff in PImage now works:
  + filter(GRAY) will convert a PImage to grayscale. 
  + filter(INVERT) will invert an image
  + filter(POSTERIZE, int levels) will posterize to that many levels
  + filter(THRESHOLD) or filter(THRESHOLD, float midpoint)
    will give you a black and white image, with optionally settable
    midpoint (a value from 0 to 1)
  + coming soon is filter(BLUR) and filter(BLUR, float radius)...

- strokeCap/strokeJoin constants for MITERED is now MITER, BEVELED is BEVEL, 
  and PROJECTED is now PROJECT.

- as of 0077, font.width() works differently. it returns the width of
  a one point font, not the font at its current size. the font api
  built into PGraphics/PApplet now consists of:

  public void textFont(PFont which);
  public void textFont(PFont which, float size);
  public void textSize(float size);
  public void textLeading(float leading);
  public void textMode(int mode);
  public void textSpace(int space);
  public float textAscent();
  public float textDescent();
  public float textWidth(char c);
  public float textWidth(String s);

  instead of using PFont.width() or PFont.ascent() to get the size of
  text, you should use textWidth() or textAscent() in PGraphics/PApplet
  which will return values based on what was set in textSize().

- bezierVertex has changed. instead of four calls to bezierVertex, 
  you should instead use:
  vertex(x1, y1);
  bezierVertex(x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);
  this helps iron out some inconsistencies that you get with the wrong
  number of bezierVertex coords. it also prevents you from having to 
  double up the final coordinate to draw the next segment.

- got rid of CONCAVE_POLYGON and CONVEX_POLYGON since they never really
  came into full use.


bug fixes: 

- curveVertex works again.

- lines of text were getting mashed together both horizontally and
  vertically. the font stuff was moved around a lot in 0077 and so
  this made a mess of things.

- backwards rectangles and ellipses are now drawn properly. (i.e. 
  rectangles where (x2 < x1) or (y2 < y1), or ellipses with a 
  negative width or height).

- same thing for backwards images, note that an image drawn backwards
  won't actually flip the image or anything nutty like that.

- the file open dialog on macosx now lets you open files ending 
  with all caps .PDE instead of .pde

- imageMode() was broken

- loadPixels, updatePixels, save, and saveFrame were totally broken 
  and now they work in both the Java2D and OpenGL renderers.

- patched in the latest version of jogl to hopefully fix some of the
  overly chatty error messages.

- SCREEN_SPACE text is working again

- tint() is now working properly, except that it ignores colors (but
  accepts alpha) with PGraphics3 (processing renderer with depth())

- arc was broken and inconsistent, now fixed.

- several bug fixes inside Camera and Movie.

- PImage.get() had a bug where it wouldn't properly read data as
  you neared or crossed any of the edges of the image.

- bug in the gl renderer that had images drawing the wrong size/shape.

ABOUT REV 0079 - 31 March 2005,,79,2005-03-31 00:00:00-05:00,"* horizontal toolbar! new colors! current line number indicator! *

cosmetic fixes only in today's release. we lost our internet connection
last night before i could post rev 78 for windows, so if casey returns
from his meeting soon enough, we'll also post a rev 79 for windows (and 
just skip 78 since we didn't get to it).

- you must delete your preferences.txt file for this release, 
  otherwise things are gonna look super ugly.
  on macosx: ~/Library/Processing/preferences.txt
  on windows: Documents and Settings/username/
              Application Data/Processing/preferences.txt

- the ui is now blonde... casey decided that it was time to go horizontal 
  with the toolbar buttons. drunk with power, he wound up re-coloring
  everything while he was at it. as a result your prefs need to be nuked
  the first time you run with this release.

- added a status bar at the bottom of the screen that displays the 
  current line number (or range). this is an interim solution until
  we can put in real line numbers, but hopefully this does the trick
  for a while, since the text editor component we use doesn't support
  line numbers. 

- ctrl-O added for the ""Open"" menu item. don't get too wild.

ABOUT REV 0080 - 2 April 2005,,80,2005-04-02 00:00:00-05:00,"bug fix and api tweaking release... um yeah.


- examples have finally been updated in this release, please test!

- keywords have also been updated

- when exporting an applet, you can now include a description in the
  applet text. the format is a javadoc comment, where the first line
  should contain /** and the final line */ so the following would work:
  /**
   * You can't rock Processing like I can rock Processing.
   */
  and that text would automatically be embedded in the exported html 
  page. like a javadoc comment, the text can (and should) be any valid
  html since it's just gonna get embedded right in the page.


graphics

- fixed opengl bug that was causing some color components to flip on the mac

- removed mask(PImage someImage, PImage theMask)
  just use someImage.mask(theMask) instead

- filter(BLUR) and filter(BLUR, float radius) rock
  donated code from quasimondo that does a gaussian blur on an image

- set(x, y, argb) and set(x, y, PImage) now work inside opengl

- copy(PImage, x, y) has become set(x, y, PImage)

- blend(), copy(), and filter() now work for opengl

- textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE) -> textureMode(NORMALIZED)
  textureMode(IMAGE_SPACE) -> textureMode(IMAGE)

- goodbye sphere(x, y, z, r), you're inconsistent with the api


text changes

- textMode(ALIGN_LEFT) -> textAlign(LEFT)
  textMode(ALIGN_RIGHT) -> textAlign(RIGHT)
  textMode(ALIGN_CENTER) -> textAlign(CENTER)

- textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) -> textMode(SCREEN)
  textSpace(OBJECT_SPACE) -> textMode(OBJECT)

- text() in a box is now fixed again (sometimes a word would hang
  outside the box)

- textFont(font) now sets the font to its ""natural"" size by default
  (the size used for ""Create Font"")

- font.size is an int that contains the original size of the font


forgot to mention for previous releases:

- point() should be working in opengl again

- to make a copy of an image, just use get(), which is the same as
  get(0, 0, image.width, image.height)

- copy(PImage, x, y) has been replaced by set(x, y, PImage) for better
  parity with the get() methods.

- macosx users can once again scroll downwards in the console, 
  thanks to the little bar with the line numbers

- arc() was made to behave more properly

ABOUT REV 0081 - 4 april 2005,,81,2005-04-04 00:00:00-04:00,"* major api changes in this release *

we're nearing the end of our general f-ing with the api, but we've
once again broken things. this time, we've moved around how renderers
work. 

- depth() is gone, and so is the renderer menu, in its place, we
  have a new method for specifying how you want to render. 

  so now, size(200, 200) this allocates a 2D buffer to draw into, 
  using the Java2D engine or the original 1.1-compliant engine depending 
  on whether or not you're using Java 1.3 or higher.

  or this gets the original processing 2D renderer:
  (which is often better for pixel operations, though is currently quite
  borked.. lines and whatnot don't work properly)
  size(200, 200, P2D);

  this provides the original processing 3D renderer:
  size(200, 200, P3D);

  and this loads (drum roll) opengl:
  size(200, 200, OPENGL);

- gl.glXxxxXxx no longer works, because the base applet is just a 
  regular PApplet, not a PAppletGL. this is a bummer but a small
  price to pay for all the goodness that comes with the way that
  the new size() function works. in order to get the gl object to 
  draw to, use the following ugly piece of code. 
  GL gl = ((PGraphicsGL) g).gl;
  you may also want/need to add the following import statement 
  (did you know we support imports? not sure if this was mentioned
  back around 70 or whenever they were implemented)
  import net.java.games.jogl.GL;

- the applet placement, sizing, and window issues should now be sorted
  out completely. no more windows showing up in weird places or applets
  being offset strangely within them.

- present mode has been rewritten to use java's proper full screen api.
  no more ghetto full screen with menubar on osx. should be more stable
  than it was in the past. also note that things running in presentation
  mode will run using an external java vm, rather than inside the 
  environment itself.

- processing itself requires java 1.4. it's sort of required it for a 
  little while, but this is now made explicit in the code. if you're lucky
  a new erorr dialog will pop up and tell you to install a newer version 
  if you try running under 1.3 or whatever.

- background(PImage) should now be working in opengl

- saveFrame() path bug fixed

- preferences madness
  + preferences panel is now a modal dialog, and doesn't hide the 
    editor window in the weird way it used to. 
  + you can also click the link to the preferences .txt file and it'll 
    open in whatever your default text editor is on your machine.
  + editor font size is now a preference that can be set from the 
    prefs window.
  + fixed a bug where prefs were applied even if you hit cancel.

- lots more internal fixes and tweaking that we'll be documenting 
  soon (i.e. the new renderer setup means pluggable renderers, or 
  PApplet has lots of fancy command line options like --present)


* other bits to note *

- it should also be noted again that java 1.1 stuff is almost 
  completely unusable in this release. the PApplet class temporarily
  contains some 1.4-specific code (which will be removed) and the
  graphics engine still doesn't work. so this version isn't useful
  for exporting things to the web.

- there are a bunch of bugs with save & save as... quirky things 
  about folders not winding up in the right place and whatnot. 
  looking to fix these this week

- release 82 (or 83?) will be all about getting proper 3D lighting,
  camera, and geometry working. simon's done some amazing work.

- if anyone's looking at the cvs, you'll need to do a 
  ""cvs update -d -P"" because the folder structure has moved around
  for this release.

ABOUT REV 0082 - 6 april 2005,,82,2005-04-06 00:00:00-04:00,"- casey has updated the examples, reference, and keywords.

- default lighting now works.. lights() and noLights() should properly
  make things look 3D and pretty... this is all thanks to simon. there 
  are a ton of features that come along with this, but we're testing
  them and finalizing the api first before announcing them.

- default window height is no longer insufficient (after prefs were
  deleted on windows, on the next run the window was smashed)

- ""sto"" is now ""stop"" while in present mode

- it looks as though the opengl libraries weren't properly added in
  the last release. no more.

- added an extra requestFocus() for opengl

- added ryan's grow box design for osx


known problems

- P2D still badly broken (no lines, etc)

- flicker still likely in java2d.. the applet and graphics threads
  aren't playing nicely with each other

- stop button still broken.. had it fixed for a minute but a bunch 
  of other problems reappeared. 

- dragging the applet window around will usually halt it (especially
  with opengl)

- println() is super slow

- moving the main p5 window to another screen just gets thrown out, 
  to prevent a case where a second display is unplugged. this will 
  change in a future release to properly record its previous position
  and what monitor it was on.

ABOUT REV 0083 - 17 april 2005,,83,2005-04-17 00:00:00-04:00,"- new reference and examples in this release. please test!

- readme.txt and bugs.txt have been removed in favor of a single FAQ,
  which contains the appropriate information, and will be mirrored as
  the FAQ on processing.org as well.

- what he hope is the finalized lighting api for beta/1.0

  + because lights are in object space, they are considered more
    like a shape in this release. they are not retained and must
    be ""drawn"" each time you run through draw(). 

  + to enable a simple ambient and directional light, place inside draw:
    public void lights();  

  + ambientLight(float r, float g, float b) 
    adds an ambient light based on the current colorMode.

  + directionalLight(r, g, b, vx, vy, vz);
    sets up a direction light along vector vx, vy, vz

  + spotLight(r, g, b, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, angle); 
    sets up a spotlight at a position, with a direction and an angle

  + lightFalloff(constant, linear, quadratic) 
    will change the falloff for any lights that follow. 
    default setting is lightFalloff(1, 0, 0)

  + lightSpecular(r, g, b) 
    sets the specular color for any lights that follow.

  + ambient(), emissive(), specular() set the material properties
    of shapes. they take the same form as fill() and stroke(). 

  + shininess(float shiney) takes a float from 0..1 to specify
    the level of shininess for the current material

- video camera api should now be finalized:

  + we're still debating on whether to rename Camera to something
    else. we just can't think of a good name.

  + that whole thing with passing null or """" to the camera constructor
    was really silly. now either one will just give you the default
    video input device. 

  + added settings() which will show the settings dialog

  + source() takes parameters TUNER, COMPOSITE, SVIDEO or COMPONENT
    to select the input source.

  + format() takes parameters NTSC, SECAM or PAL

  + crop(x, y, w, h) (uses the current imageMode from the parent
    applet) will crop the video before putting it into its PImage. 
    this is almost always used internally because qt likes to add
    black bars to the image, but you can now specify your own 
    settings to crop things further

  + noCrop() will remove any cropping, providing a speed increase.

  + there may be bugs.. things were sometimes hanging on my machine 
    when there were errors 

- link() now works when running as an application. also added
  open(String filename) which will attempt to launch an application 
  using the shell, or open(String args[]) which will do the same
  with several command line args.

- nfc() joins the nf() family to format integers and floats with commas.

- linux version returns, with several fixes, and now handles 
  (warns about) libstdc++ incompatabilities with jikes


The last remaining things before Beta:

- make sure there isn't any super badness in the current version

- fix the ""save as"" bugs

- ""create font"" is somewhat broken in this release

board, thanks to everyone who's been reporting things. 


[ tab madness ] 

- better at handling errors across multiple tabs 

- undo now works properly between tabs (undo used to be cleared 
  when changing a tab, or on each error)

- when using multiple tabs (but no .java files or code folder or libs)
  things will still run inside p5, meaning they'll start up more quickly

- renaming a .java file now includes the .java in the name, so that 
  you don't accidentally make the file a .pde file


[ tools ] 

- auto format has been replaced by code long since contributed by 
  martin gomez. thanks to martin, things should improve significantly. 
  better yet, if there are problems, we can yell at him about em!

- archive sketch saves before archiving, hopefully reducing confusion


[ export ] 

- new default html for exported applets

- shows a processing loading image instead of sun's awful starburst 
  java coffee cup. like applet.html, this can be customized by placing 
  a file inside your sketch folder called 'loading.gif'


[ core/api ] 

- ceil(), floor(), and round() now return ints instead of floats

- master gain error in PSound won't make the sound unusable, it'll just
  shut off the ability to control volume. (a java 1.5 problem?)

- fixed createFont() for built-in fonts


[ minor fixes ] 

- errors (exception stack traces, for the technical)  properly show up
  across multiple lines.. sometimes they used to get spammed onto a single 
  line, making them difficult to read.

- run-expert.bat was unintentionally a little too expert, and required
  editing before use.


[ platforms ] 

- windows and linux java have been updated for java 1.4.2_08

- windows java download includes the proper files for handling 
  non-european systems

  triangulated vectors that will eventually allow for exporting vector
  text from OpenGL applications.

- PGraphics.save() no longer inserts the prefix to the applet folder,

    from p5 applets looking for files in their data folders.
  + the open and load functions now handle subfolders inside the data 
    folder. subfolders in the data folder are now included on export. 
    http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=218
    http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=65
  + instead of halting the applet, a missing file (i.e. with loadImage()
    or loadStrings()) will return null and print an error to the console. 
    this is better for people who know how to deal with null values, 
    but hopefully the others will actually read the console to see the
    error otherwise, because the end result will be a NullPointerException.

- deal with some issues where applets weren't running or were closing
  immediately in revision 0094/0095.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=210
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=204

- when loading a PNG image, set the image to ARGB if it has an alpha 
  channel. also fix a bug in the GIF image alpha channel checking.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=217

- fixed a text block wrap problem when a manual break character (\n)
  was used: http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=188

- remove some unnecessary applet resizing that was happening whenever
  an applet was loaded. this would sometimes cause the wrong window
  size to be used by appletviewer, or cause applets to start at their
  correct size, then resize to 100x100, and then resize to their correct
  location once setup() was complete.


[ api ] 

- hint(DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST) will disable the zbuffer in P3D or OPENGL.
  re-enable with noHint(DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST);

- added methods for libraries to be able to get sketch folder paths.
  the variable 'folder', which was changed to 'path' for rev 0094 is
  now called 'sketchPath', and won't change again. see the javadoc 
  reference on dev.processing.org for more details on this and the
  additional functions:
  + sketchPath() returns the path to a file in the sketch folder.
  + dataPath() returns the path to a file inside the data folder.
  + createPath() will take any path and make sure that the 
    interstitial folders exist. this is used by saveFrame() and 
    savePath() to make sure that the parent folders exist. 
    for instance, saveFrame(""image/blah.tif"") will use createPath() 
    to ensure that the folder ""image"" exists inside the sketch folder.
  + savePath() is like sketchPath() but uses createPath() to make 
    sure that it's save to save there.
  this will probably break the libraries again, but hopefully with 
  this change, they should stop breaking going forward.

- changed unhint() to noHint() to match the rest of the api.
  i don't think anyone was using this so hopefully it won't affect 
  anything.


[ misc ] 

- macosx release is now packaged with as a .dmg instead of a .sitx
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=116

- added reference category to the bugs db so that reference issues
  can be handled there as well.

he was running into with while writing the book. A handful of bug
fixes I figured I'd post for the more adventurous, before adding
anything more complex to it.

Not as necesary a release as the others but has some useful fixes and
I'll need to know whether or not there are any regressions before the
next ""big"" release.


[ bug fixes ] 

+ fixes for linux shell script for ""export to application"" 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=234
  thanks to x771771 at fixless.com for the report and fix.

+ more edits are now a compound edit, so hitting ""Undo"" after ""Auto
  Format"" will undo to the previous state, instead of first going to a
  blank screen and requiring a second ""Undo."" this is particularly
  noticeable when bugs in Auto Format cause code to be mangled, and
  hitting undo would ""delete"" the code entirely (a second undo would
  fix things, but not everyone figured that out). 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=139

+ several fixes to ""Auto Format"", however many more bugs uncovered in
  the process. unfortunately the code was contributed and then
  abandoned by its original author, making it difficult to maintain.

+ better bug handling with auto format. if an exception occurs, 
  auto format should return without mangling your code.

+ once again fixed a bug where width and height were set to zero in
  static mode apps. hopefully fixed properly this time:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=198

+ fixed a bug where play() wouldn't play a sound the second time
  unless stop() had been called on it.


[ changes ] 

+ updated to java 1.4.2_10 on windows and linux. the former version
  was 1.4.2_08, though _10 will be out of sync with macosx which is 
  currently at 1.4.2_09. 

+ updated notes in the javadoc about how the preprocessor works.

+ made auto format more verbal in reporting errors and differences to
  the editor. won't change anything unless actual changes occur, and
  if an misbalanced parenthesis situation occurs, it's reported as an
  error.


[ api changes ] 

+ recordShapes() and recordShapesRaw() will be record() and
  recordRaw(), though they remain mostly unimplemented.

ABOUT REV 0100 - 13 January 2006,,100,2006-01-13 00:00:00-05:00,"This is a pre-release of the PDF generating code. There will be a couple 
other quick releases to follow in the coming days, and this shouldn't be
considered a ""stable"" release since it's not been tested heavily, but we
wanted to post it for the people who'd like to try it out.

To use it the pdf library, select Sketch -> Import Library -> pdf. 
And then choose one of the following methods:

+ to render everything out to a file:

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400, PDF, ""filename.pdf"");
  }

  void draw() {
    // draw something good here
  }

  void mousePressed() {
    exit();  // important!
  }

  this will create a sketch that draws only to a file. successive frames
  will be drawn on top of one another. when you're finished, call exit(), 
  for instance, inside mousePressed() or a keyPressed() event.
  this will still open a window of size 400x400 but not draw into it. 
  future releases won't open the window, since it doesn't work properly 
  with sizes larger than the screen size (as might often be the case when
  rendering to a file).

+ if you want to record just a single frame, use beginRecord() and
  endRecord() inside draw:

  void draw() {
    beginRecord(PDF, ""frame-####.pdf"");
    // your awesome drawing happens here. 
    endRecord();  // saves the file
  }

  this can also be triggered by a mouse press. the #### will cause a
  four digit ""frame"" number to be inserted into the filename.

+ if you want to record the entire thing to a file at the same time as 
  drawing to the screen (i.e. save out an interactive drawing), do this:

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400);
    // etc
    beginRecord(PDF, ""everything.pdf"");
  }

  void draw() {
    // do your worst
  }

  // this needn't be mousePressed, but you need to call this somewhere
  // when you're done, to ensure that the pdf file properly closes.
  void mousePressed() {
    endRecord();
  }

Caveats with PDF rendering: 

+ anything bitmapped works very poorly. so it's no good for images.

+ use createFont() with a truetype font (some opentype also work) to
  make fonts work properly. any font that shows up in PFont.list() 
  should work. if you don't use createFont(), they'll likely show up 
  bitmappy and gross like images. the shape of the characters may be 
  weird in some cases, there seems to be a java bug with cubic vs. 
  quadric splines. looking into a workaround if necessary. 

+ rendering from 3D isn't yet supported, but coming soon. 

+ exit() is really important when using PDF with size()

+ A DXF file exporter. Lines and triangles from P3D or OPENGL

  shortcuts, you can copy/paste the values for the colors and paste 
  them into your program. (We didn't do any sort of auto-insert of
  colorMode() or fill() or stroke() code cuz we couldn't decide on a 
  good way to do this.. your contributions welcome).

+ We've decided to include versions of image and textFont that take
  a filename instead of requiring a call to loadImage(). This is less 
  efficient than using loadImage because there's no way to unload it 
  from memory, but it's useful for beginners.

  void image(String filename, float x, float y)

  void image(String filename, float x, float y, float c, float d)

  void image(String filename,
             float a, float b, float c, float d,
             int u1, int v1, int u2, int v2)

  void textFont(String filename)

  void textFont(String filename, float size)

+ The discourse formatter tool posted to the discourse board by owd 
  has been added to the Tools menu. We're distributing it for now

the JOGL library. Most importantly, this version is a Universal Binary

Some notes about this release: 

+ This new OpenGL setup has not been tested very much. Basically
  I got things working and thought I was so cool that I just had
  to post the new release.

+ Even though it will be easier to do because of the new JOGL, 
  support for the OPENGL renderer in applets is still unavailable.

+ The main reason for the lack of applet support is simply that 
  I haven't yet had time to try to get this to work. An enterprising 
  individual might give this a shot if they have a chance to look
  into how this is done with the new JOGL (known as JSR-231). There
  are .jar files for jogl that will be exported with a p5 applet 
  that are signed by Sun. Note that the version for Mac OS X does
  *not* support Intel Macs. The .jnilib files were built on my own, 
  but the .jar files were left intact because of the signing.
  
+ The release of JOGL is the nightly build dated 22 March 2006.

+ Lots more fixes for OpenGL are on the way, next on deck are
  fixes for a lot of texture mapping (and image drawing) issues.

  http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PImage.html#save(java.lang.String)

+ loadImage() also supports image loading in the same manner, 
  though it's not recommended for projects that export to the web. 
  Again, more detailed information is in the developer's reference:
  http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PApplet.html#loadImage(java.lang.String)

+ The image loading and saving issues were covered by Bug #165.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=165

+ loadImage() now works with TIFF and Targa images created by Processing. 
  It will probably not support TIFF or Targa files created by other programs. 
  Use PNG or another image format if you want to load images.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=260

+ fixed issue with beginRaw() that made the stroke of objects appear with
  no transformations (even though the fill was properly transformations) 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=339

+ removed debugging messages from loadPixels() and PGraphics2.save()

+ fixed error message that prevented DXF from being used with OpenGL

+ added arraycopy(from[], to[], count)

+ renaming a sketch now rebuilds the sketch menu (accidental regression
  as the result of a bug fix and moving some code around)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=332

[ issues ]

+ You cannot set the level of compression when writing JPEG:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=342

+ TIFF writing does not support images that are ARGB or ALPHA format.

ABOUT REV 0116 - 28 September 2006,,116,2006-09-28 00:00:00-04:00,"This is a major release. It contains a million billion bug fixes, 
as well as several API changes as we try to firm up the API for 1.0.

          *** PLEASE READ ALL THESE NOTES CAREFULLY ***
          ***     YOUR CODE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED!    ***

If you don't want to update your code yet, and are just trying to get
your coursework done, you may want to stick with release 0115.

+ The reference has received major updates. The contents of the FAQ
  have now been integrated into the reference. The remaining page
  of the FAQ has more details about where everyone went:
  http://processing.org/faq.html

+ framerate() is now called frameRate(), for better API consistency.
  It didn't make sense to have a frameCount variable and a framerate()
  method as its misshapen cousin. 

+ The default frameRate is now 60 fps. This will prevent some odd
  quirks with sketches running faster than they need to and throttling
  the resources of your machine. To disable this, you can set the 
  frameRate arbitrarily high.

+ beginShape() has changed. LINE_LOOP and LINE_STRIP have been 
  removed because they are redundant, and not consistent with the 
  rest of the API. beginShape(POLYGON) is no longer recommended, 
  simply use beginShape() with no parameters when drawing an
  irregular shape. Code examples:

  OLD SYNTAX:
  beginShape(POLYGON);
  // call vertex() several times
  endShape()

  NEW SYNTAX:
  beginShape();
  // call vertex() several times
  endShape(CLOSE);

  endShape() with the CLOSE parameter will make the stroke on your
  shape continue back to where the shape started. This is the same
  way that POLYGON and LINE_LOOP worked.

  OLD_SYNTAX:
  beginShape(LINE_STRIP);
  // draw with vertex()
  endShape();

  NEW SYNTAX:
  noFill();
  beginShape();
  // draw with vertex();
  endShape();

  In the above case, noFill() must be called, and the CLOSE parameter 
  to endShape() is not used, because the last point should not come 
  back to meet the original point.

  OLD SYNTAX:
  beginShape(LINE_LOOP);
  // draw with vertex()
  endShape();

  NEW SYNTAX:
  noFill();
  beginShape();
  // draw with vertex();
  endShape(CLOSE);

  For the LINE_LOOP example, endShape(CLOSE) is used to specify close the
  shape. noFill() must also be called, so that the shape is not filled in.

  The two main problems with the old API were 1) LINE_LOOP was simply a 
  POLYGON with no fill setting, this made for a strange inconsistency.
  2) there was no way to draw a non-closed POLYGON shape. 

  Using beginShape(POLYGON) doesn't make much sense when you're drawing 
  a line, so this is one more reason that beginShape() with no parameters
  is recommended.

+ The single pixel blend() methods have been removed, they were 
  overkill. Also, the blend() function that blends a color, instead
  of image data, is now called blendColor().

+ Along with blendColor(), a lerpColor() method has been added.
  It works just like lerp()... but with colors!

+ writer() and reader() are now createWriter() and createReader().
  These weren't really documented, so the change doesn't officially
  ""count"" per se, but maybe someone was using 'em.

+ toInt() and toFloat() are now parseInt() and parseFloat(), 
  to change to JavaScript syntax. Not sure if anyone was using these.

+ Text with the JAVA2D setting no longer uses native fonts by default,
  which means they'll be slower and uglier. See the reference for
  textFont() for details and how it can be addressed.

+ Threading has been modified signficantly. Some of these changes 
  had to be undone at the last minute, so further changes are coming.
  The changes will fix several strange InterruptedException problems.


[ major changes to PGraphics and its subclasses ] 

+ The PGraphics classes have all been reworked and renamed.

  - PGraphics is an abstract class on which additional PGraphics
    subclasses can be built. It is an abstract class, and therefore
    cannot be invoked directly. 

  - PGraphics2D (P2D) contains the former contents of PGraphics that 
    are specific to 2D rendering. This will be P2D once it is complete.

  - PGraphics3D (P3D), formerly PGraphics3, remains mostly unchanged.

  - PGraphicsJava2D (JAVA2D), formerly PGraphics2, is the renderer 
    used when you call for size(width, height, JAVA2D). It remains 
    the default renderer when none is specified. It is slower but 
    more accurate than the others.

  - PGraphicsOpenGL (OPENGL) is the new name for PGraphicsGL.

+ Do not use ""new PGraphics"" to create PGraphics objects.
  Instead, use createGraphics(), which will properly handle connecting
  the new graphics object to its parent sketch, and will enable save()
  to work properly. See the reference for createGraphics:
  http://processing.org/reference/createGraphics_.html

+ For the same reasons as above, createImage(width, height, format) 
  should be used instead of ""new PImage"" when creating images:
  http://processing.org/reference/createImage_.html

+ PImage objects default to ARGB instead of RGB format. This is 
  helpful for using createImage() or createGraphics() to generate
  a transparent surface. Be sure to use PNG or another format that
  supports alpha.

+ beginFrame() and endFrame() are now beginDraw() and endDraw(). 
  Use these around drawing commands to a PGraphics created by
  createGraphics(). The defaults() method should not/need not
  be called, just beginDraw() and endDraw().
  

[ other additions and enhancements ]

+ Added an option to Preferences that sets the available memory 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233

+ Added a menu option to switch between tabs
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=55
  however, there's a problem where it sometimes stops working:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=402

+ The OpenGL library has been updated to use the ""final"" release 
  of JOGL 1.0, released September 2006, rather than beta 4, found
  in release 0115. 

+ The flag in PApplet.main() formerly called --present-stop-color 
  is now simply --stop-color. A flag named --hide-stop has also 
  been added, to prevent users from quitting out of a present mode 
  application. see the faq on details for capturing ESC as well.

+ Altered mouse behavior so that mouse positions update only on 
  mouseMoved and mouseDragged. this also fixes a macosx bug that 
  caused mouseX/Y values to be bizarre because mouseExited() 
  gave weird positions (workaround for apple bug).

+ The ""Export Folder"" Tool has been removed, if temporarily.

+ ""Archive Sketch"" now prompts for a sketch name, it was awkward
  trying to dig the sketches out of the sketchbook folder.

+ added constant for DXF so recordRaw(DXF, ""blah.dxf"") can be 
  used instead of recordRaw(""processing.dxf.RawDXF"", ""blah.dxf"")

+ Make all array functions work on arrays of all types:
  expand, append, contract, subset, splice, concat, reverse
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=115

+ Added alpha parameter to color/stroke/tint/fill for use with
  web colors. i.e. fill(#FF8800, 30) is now valid.

+ Removed image(filename) and textFont(filename) et al. These made a 
  brief appearance for the last release, but were not a good idea.

+ URLs with ampersands now supported on Windows, thanks to toxi.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1149974261

+ Only update mouseX and mouseY when mouse is moved and dragged. Fixes 
  certain kinds of sketches, and also avoids a Mac OS X bug that causes
  sketches to jump as you move the mouse to the edge of the window.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=170

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix several issues with filling shapes generated by beginShape(), 
  particularly when used with bezierVertex() and curveVertex().

+ Fix a regression that appeared in 0116+ that prevented curveVertex()

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=386

+ Lots of issues with createFont(), PDF rendering of fonts, and 
  hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS). Also added lots of notes to the reference
  based on frequently asked questions.

+ maintain selection, current tab, and scroll position on ""save as""

+ Fixed issue where ambientLight(r, g, b) was instead ambientLight(r, g, r)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=412

[ functional improvements ]

+ With the PDF library, text no longer defaults to raw shape outlines. 
  Details (and a means to revert to the old behavior) in the reference:
  http://processing.org/reference/libraries/pdf/

+ Trying the Quaqua Look & Feel on Mac OS X with the hope of things 
  looking better. Not sure if we'll keep this. The main issue it fixes
  is that it improves the Swing dialogs for file choosers, however
  another workaround was found for that, so now it mostly just improves
  the ""Save changes?"" dialogs.

+ Trying the GTK+ Look & Feel on Linux. The old default (Metal) from
  Java was truly dreadful.

+ When ""Auto Format"" produces a warning, no code will be changed. In some
  cases, this was mangling code, so to be safe, it's been disabled.
  Near term, we'd like to swap out Auto Format with new code altogether.

+ Using createGraphics() now properly creates an empty, completely 
  transparent drawing surface that can be written to a file. The alpha
  channel will also be written for the file if using a file format
  (such as PNG) that supports transparency.

If this is the first release you're using since 0115 or earlier, 
please read the section below that contains the release notes for 0116.

and some other minor tweaks.

[ features! ] 

+ Printing a tab is now supported (but with caveats)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=27
  The""Page Setup"" dialog doesn't work very well because Java seems 
  to suck at printing, and sucks differently on different platforms:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=435
  Also, only the current tab is printed:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=28

+ Added background() with alpha parameters, but only for use with 
  graphics created by createGraphics(). Also, it replaces the pixels
  with pixels that have that alpha, it's not like drawing a semi-
  transparent rect() onto the screen. For instance, to make a drawing 
  surface transparent again, use background(0, 0, 0, 0). Using
  background(0, 0, 0, 128) will replace the background with black
  pixels that are 50% transparent, it will not fade the existing 
  image toward black, use a rect() for that.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ size(), beginRecords(), beginRaw(), and createGraphics() were broken 
  for file-based renderers in 0120

+ Fixed overly fat buttons on OS X due to a previous workaround that's
  no longer a problem because we're using (testing?) the Quaqua L&F.

ABOUT REV 0122 - 28 November 2006,,122,2006-11-28 00:00:00-05:00,"Lots of bug fixes and two new libraries.

[ features ] 

+ Michael Chang's ""Candy"" SVG Importer has been expanded significantly 
  and added as a ""core"" library. We are grateful to Michael for his
  contribution to the project. 

+ A simple XML library (processing.xml) has been added. It is based on
  NanoXML, and requires documents to be very strictly formatted, and
  doesn't support some XML features. 

+ For both of these new libraries, they are intentionally minimal 
  implementations. A full XML library or a full SVG import/export 
  library would be quite significant in size. We think it's instead
  helpful to have libraries that can be included as part of an applet, 
  meaning that they should be no larger than around 20-30k. If you 
  don't need the compact size, you can use a larger XML library, 
  or something like Apache's Batik to handle SVG import.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Lots of work done to improve the formatting, and also make the
  key combinations work more appropriately for the various platforms.
  For instance, HOME and END keys now move to the beginning or end
  of the document, while ctrl-left and right (cmd-left and right on mac) 
  moves to the beginning or the end of a line. Outdenting when a brace
  is used and some other quirks have been ironed out more. 
  Shift-backspace now also produces 'delete', which is a useful thing
  found in many programming text editors. Also text selection and arrow 
  issues like http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=349
  This is one of several fixes that improve the use of the arrow keys
  along with cmd/alt-right/left and others. In general, the editor 
  has been mostly brought up to spec for how keys work. 

+ Fixed the menu shortcuts for next and previous tab:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=402

+ Fixed a problem where clicking the close box of Processing, then hitting
  ""Cancel"" when asked to save changes, would close the window anyway.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=440

+ Changed ""Format for Discourse"" to ""Copy for Discourse"", which just 
  copies the code directly to the clipboard so it can easily be
  pasted into the forum. The UI was too goofy before.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=447

+ Forgot to mention, there was a fix added in revision 0120 that
  prevented files dragged into a sketch from bouncing back to the 
  desktop on Mac OS X. (It formerly gave the impression that the 
  file was not properly added to the sketch).

+ noiseSeed() was only working once, and only before noise() was used.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1162856262

+ lerpColor() now honors the current color mode. Also added support
  for lerpColor(c1, c2, MODE) where MODE is RGB or HSB.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1160096087

+ Fixed a regression in P3D/OPENGL that prevented points from drawing
  in some areas of the screen.

ABOUT REV 0125 - 15 July 2007,,125,2007-07-15 00:00:00-04:00,"Enormous number of bug fixes and additions. Many thanks to ewjordan 
and fjen, who also contributed fixes for this release.


[ api changes ] 

+ Changed the constructors for the Capture class to be more consistent 
  with the rest of the video library. The following constructors:
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height)
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height, int rate)
  Capture(PApplet parent, String name, int width, int height)
  Capture(PApplet parent, String name, int width, int height, int rate)
  have been changed to:
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height)
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height, int rate)
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height, String name)
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height, String name, int rate)
  This version is not particularly consistent:
  Capture(PApplet parent, int width, int height, int rate)
  though we'll be leaving it in because it was used so heavily.

+ The split() method has been altered to avoid inconsistency. In fact,
  it has split itself into two methods. Har har har.
  split(String s), has been removed, use splitTokens(String s) instead.
  split(String s, char c) remains unchanged.
  split(String s, String delim) is now splitTokens(String s, String delim)
  The new model is that split() breaks a String into pieces given a single
  delmiter, which can be a single character or many characters. For instance,
  split(""Something<BR>in<BR><BR>HTML."", ""<BR>"") 
  now produces the array ""Something"", ""in"", """", ""HTML"". 
  The split() method breaks the String whenever it sees the delimiter, 
  so a <BR> next to another <BR> produces an empty String. 
  On the other hand, splitTokens() takes a list of possible delimiters, 
  and will consume one or more of any of them. For instance:
  splitTokens(""really, messed ,up with ,,, commas,"", "", "");
  will produce the array ""really"", ""messed"", ""up"", ""with"", ""commas"".
  Because any group of comma or space characters (and in any order) 
  will simply be consumed as a single break.

+ The casting functions, e.g. int(), float() boolean(), and friends
  have now been streamlined a bit to only cover casts that actually
  make sense.

+ Blending modes have been finalized for 1.0, thanks to the help
  of Dave Bollinger, who contributed code to complete the set:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=132  
  See the reference for blend() for more details. Thanks Dave!

+ The constant CENTER_RADIUS is now simply RADIUS. Both still work, 
  but CENTER_RADIUS should be avoided.

+ The constants for ENTER, TAB, et al. are now char values, 
  rather than ints.

+ The framerate() method in the movie library has been renamed to 
  frameRate().

+ Addition from Tom Hulbert to add setDTR() to the Serial library.

+ Where possible, more methods inside PApplet have been made static.
  This may break some library code (the OCD library is one example)
  until it's updated for 0125. We'll try to add a more informative
  error message about this in 0126.


[ additions, improvements ]

+ Significant improvement to text and images in OpenGL mode. 
  Now using mipmaps to interpolate large and small images.

+ The println() method with arrays now prints the array indices next 
  to each element, making it a bit more useful. The print() method
  no longer supports arrays, since that was a bit silly.

+ Major rework of the open() command. This function behaves differently
  on each platform. On Windows, the parameters are sent to the Windows 
  shell via ""cmd /c"". On Mac OS X, the ""open"" command is used (type 
  ""man open"" in Terminal.app for documentation). On Linux, it first tries
  gnome-open, then kde-open, but if neither are available, it sends the
   command to the shell without any alterations. For Java users, this 
  is not quite the same as Runtime.exec(), because the shell command 
  is prepended. The method exec(String[]) is a shortcut for 
  Runtime.getRuntime.exec(String[]). This function was also modified 
  for Mac OS X and Linux support, and to better handle spaces in 
  command names.

+ textAlign() now supports a second parameter that handles vertical 
  alignment of text. The second parameter can be TOP, CENTER, and 
  BOTTOM. 

+ Added min() and max() for float and int arrays.

+ At Casey's urging, the ""Color Picker"" is now called the 
  ""Color Selector"". 

+ Fix up MovieMaker from Dan Shiffman, also add the library to 
  the reference pages.

+ Re-architect SVG to properly inherit fill/stroke/etc from parents
  <g> object can specify fill/stroke for everyone below
  need to discern between having a fill specified and one not being present

+ Fix Find/Replace button placement, also add Replace & Find Next option

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513

+ Apple has released a Java update, which brings Java 1.4.2 on OS X
  up to release 1.4.2_12. Subsequently we have updated the version of
  Java included with the Linux and Windows releases to 1.4.2_12.

ABOUT REV 0126 - 9 October 2007,,126,2007-10-09 00:00:00-04:00,"** This should be considered more of an alpha quality release. Please 
give it a try, but We won't be making this the default download unless 
no problems are found. The model for opening and saving sketches has
changed completely. This is dangerous because if there are bugs it
can mean lost data. Use carefully, but please test! **

The biggest change to this release is that Processing now supports
multiple sketches open at once. This means that we've dispensed 
with the single window setup, and have a standard File menu (New, 
Open, Close, Save, Save As). A blank sketch is treated as an Untitled
document, and asks that you confirm its name the first time that 
it's saved. New sketches open in their own window. The sketchbook
model is still in place, serving as the default location for sketches
when they are saved the first time, but in the six years since 
we first released Processing, the single window setup has made less
and less sense.

That said, there are a handful of bug fixes in this release as well, 
and a few API changes for cleanup that happened as we worked on the
Processing book and the forthcoming ""Visualizing Data"" book.


[ ide changes ] 

+ Regular new/open/close/save/saveas model for files. Menus have been 
  moved around a bit, and Examples and Sketchbook now have their own 
  section under the File menu.


[ api changes ] 

+ Added getChild(name/path), getChildren(name/path) to the XML library.
  These allow you to grab sub-elements of a particular XMLElement by 
  their name instead of by their index. You can also specify a path
  to a particular element (a series of XML element names separated by 
  slashes) so that you can grab an item several levels deep. The 
  getChild() method grabs the first matching name, the getChildren()
  method returns an array of XMLElement objects. For the XML heads out 
  there, think of it as a poor man's XPath. A very poor man. Proper 
  documentation forthcoming in a future release.

+ Added MIN_FLOAT, MAX_FLOAT, MIN_INT, and MAX_INT as built-in 
  variables. Syntax highlighting and proper documentation coming later.

+ Added unregisterXxxxx() methods for libraries, thanks to ewjordan.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=312

+ Files with .gz extension (when opening or saving) will be automatically
  gzip uncompressed (or compressed). That means loadStrings(""blah.txt.gz"")
  will magically decompress without any additional help. And that
  saveStrings(""blah.txt.gz"", data) will compress while saving. This works
  for all API functions. To use the old openStream() method, and avoid
  the GZ business, use openStreamRaw().

+ Disable mipmapping to fix memory leaking problem with OpenGL. 
  Bug #150 was fixed, then resurrected in the same release cycle.
  A better solution (that doesn't leak memory) is coming soon.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=610

+ Added a match() method. This is a very simple way to use regular
  expressions (regexp) in your code. Calling match(data, regexp) 
  will return an array of any matched items (things in parens in
  the regexp). If you aren't familiar with regular expressions,
  this will make sense once the documentation for it has properly
  been added. This requires Java 1.4, see the ""status"" section below.

+ The sort() method that takes String[] arrays now ignores case, 
  which is usually the desired behavior when sorting strings.


[ bug fixes, additions, improvements ]

+ Repaired a problem with library export that cause export to break 
  in recent releases.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=625

+ Fixed readStringUntil() in the net library.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=606

+ Added proper icon image for Find, Preferences, and other windows.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=627

+ Fixed problem with ctrl-, typing a comma in the editor on Linux.

+ Fix drag & drop on Linux. This also has led to Java 1.5 being included
  with the Linux download, because D&D in Java 1.4 was badly broken.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=595

+ Implement ""Show Sketch Folder"" and open() for Linux.

+ Ask user for confirmation when replacing files with Sketch -> Add File.

+ Show confirmation in console when Sketch -> Add File succeeds.

+ Mac OS X now has the standard ""window modified"" indicator (a dot 
  inside the close box) that indicates that changes are unsaved.

+ Improve the speed of the sketchbook menu rebuilding. In most 
  situations, the menu will be rebuilt asynchronously (so that it does
  not hold up the rest of the program).

+ Fix problem with the version of str() that takes arrays.


[ doc updates ] 

+ Fixed some errors in the changes.html file that were out of date.

+ Lots of additional notes and tidbits in the reference.


[ status ]

+ Also FYI... We're giving up on Java releases earlier than 1.4. 
  We don't have the means to test for them, and we're simply better
  off targeting a larger percentage of users given our resources.
  Processing has evolved a lot from its early days as a fast 
  Java 1.1 graphics library, where we need to simplify things for
  ourselves by relying on Java 1.4 support across the board. 
  More about this change later.

[ pde bug fixes ]

+ Mark sketches as modified when adding files, so that they are
  saved properly.

+ Replace untitled windows with opened sketches (rather than 
  closing the old window and opening a new one)

+ Re-enable the Update Check in the PDE (was disabled in 0126).

+ Add option to not close the environment when closing the last
  window. Instead, it will open a blank sketch. This is because 
  it's not possible to keep a Java program open without a Frame
  (or rather, to have a menubar without a Frame in a Java app).

+ Several updates to the keywords.txt file, syntax highlighting
  should now be much more up to date.

+ Added reference for new versions of the XMLElement getChild() 
  and getChildren() functions that use paths. 

+ Add reference for new match() method.

+ Fix animation example to use nf().

ABOUT REV 0128 - 16 October 2007,,128,2007-10-16 00:00:00-04:00,"This release contains major changes to how size() is handled. 
It fixes two major bugs, but because size() is so fundamental, 
it may cause problems on other systems. Please test!

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Window sometimes fixed at 100x100 pixels. I *think* I've managed
  to track this guy down and finally kill it.

+ Fix problem where background was not being set when using 
  the default (Java2D) renderer and with OpenGL.

+ Sometimes the draw() method would be called twice: no more.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=587

[ changes ] 

+ Removed a lot of code (mostly reflection API mess) related to 
  making processing.core work with Java releases earlier than 1.4.
  This is probably the first time processing.core has gotten
  *smaller* in a while. This includes changes to PFont, the 
  cursor commands, the sort() methods, and some others

+ Removed versions of background() that take an alpha value. 
  Not sure why these were implemented in the first place. If you
  want background() with alpha, draw a rectangle. The problem is
  that supporting alpha for background() introduces several 
  inconsistencies with other renderers, for instance OpenGL. 
  Do you clear the zbuffer when the alpha is too low? How about
  the other buffers?

+ The sort() methods are now static.

+ Change to JDK 1.4 imports rather than Java 1.1 imports in the 
  preprocessor.

+ Fix so that Mac OS X dist script doesn't require root password.

[ additional bug fixes in 0127 ]

+ Fixed hint(DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST) with OpenGL.

+ Fix minor bug in saveStream() (not a documented function).

[ changes ] 

+ When used from the toolbar in a Processing window, New and Open will
  replace the sketch in the current window. When used from the menu
  (or via key commands) they'll open a new window. This seems to be a 
  better in-between from our old sketchbook model, and the way most
  applications behave.

+ On Mac OS X, a blank sketch will open after the last sketch is 
  closed. On Windows, closing the last sketch will quit the program. 
  These default behaviors can be overridden in the Preferences dialog.
  There is no way to have a menu bar without an open window in a 
  Java application, which is what's expected for Mac OS X apps. 
  (Java comes from the X11 world, where menu bars are inside windows)
  This split behavior (with a preference to override) is our best 
  attempt at a compromise. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=634

+ Added support for full-screen anti-aliasing with OpenGL. This is
  enabled via the hint() mechanism because it has several tradeoffs
  and its behavior across video cards varies. Use the options
  hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_2X_SMOOTH) or hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_4X_SMOOTH)
  immediately after the size() command to get lovely smooth results.
  Read the caveats in the documentation for hint(). Thanks to Mike
  Creighton and others who figured out this method earlier.

  in the next few days or weeks).

+ Add gluegen-rt back to the applet export for OpenGL.

+ Added documentation for hint() and unhint().

+ Removed auto-delete of empty sketches from the sketchbook. This is
  no longer necessary with the regular New/Open/Save model, so it's
  best to leave it out, rather than have it go awry in some way.

+ Added a disconnectEvent() for the net library Client class, which 
  is fired whenever a client...disconnects.

format. This prevents problems when moving files between different
platforms or locales. For instance, this means that any file used

UTF-8 coded if not ASCII.

  In the meantime, applet export with OpenGL is working again.

+ Fixed a problem with SVG files that use ""px"" when specifying the 
  width and height (this includes Adobe Illustrator CS 3).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=667

+ Fixed a problem with ""Save As"" under Linux. A bug in the native
  Java ""Save"" dialog was not properly handling cases where the user
  hit ""enter"" to accept a new name. Changed to use the Swing
  dialog on Linux instead.

+ Changed to another version of RXTX that should be compatible
  with Mac OS X 10.5. This version also removes the requirement for
  running macosx_setup.command. Thanks to Dave Mellis of the Arduino
  project for the help.

  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Electronics;action=display;num=1193459849

+ Add an extra redraw call to update the screen after resize events 
  on Mac OS X, even when noLoop() is used.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=664

[ changes ] 

+ Removed shortcut for ""Rename"", and changed ""New Tab"" back to 
  Ctrl-Shift-N, because it was causing problems on some 
  non-English keyboards.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=665

+ Dozens of documentation updates to video, array functions, the
  default behavior for close & quit, etc.

+ Added a noLights() method for P3D and OpenGL.  
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=666

[ upcoming ] 

+ The hint() and unhint() methods are a bit goofy. The unhint() 
  method will probably be removed or another solution pursued.

ABOUT REV 0135 - 21 November 2007,,135,2007-11-21 00:00:00-05:00,"Fairly innocuous but helpful bug fix release.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Fixed modelX(), modelY(), and modelZ().
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=486
  Also wrote documentation for modelX(), modelY(), and modelZ().

+ Brought back mipmapping for OpenGL (this helps textures look 
  better when they're resized significantly). Turns out that I was
  on a goose chase, that things were working properly in rev 0125.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=610

+ Fixed copy() so that it doesn't need an updatePixels() call when 
  used with OPENGL and JAVA2D. You should only have to call
  loadPixels() and updatePixels() when you're actually messing with 
  the pixels[] array of an image (or the main drawing surface).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=681

+ Improved how fonts are handled in the preferences file to ensure
  against errors. Some strange things popping up with Processing
  not starting up properly and giving ominous ""Fatal Exception"" or
  ""Failed Startup"" messages. Though it's still not clear how the file
  was getting corrupted (whether operator error or something that 
  a recent Java release is doing).

ABOUT REV 0136 - 29 May 2008,,136,2008-05-29 00:00:00-04:00,"This release represents the first of a set of major (internal) 
changes as we head to release 1.0 at the end of the Summer. 
This release will not be made the default download, but please 
test the release for problems on your platform, and file bugs 
(dev.processing.org/bugs) when you find them.

[ major changes, please read ] 

+ New Runner
  The most significant change in this release is the introduction
  of a new runner system. This means that we'll be able to make the 
  stop button behave properly, shut down sketches correctly, have 
  better error handling, and eventually add debugger support. 
  On the downside, sketches may start a little more slowly, and it 
  may be a bumpy transition as we get things working (strange errors 
  when you hit Run).

+ Switching to Java 1.5
  We are moving to Java 1.5 as a minimum requirement for running 
  Processing, as well as sketches created with it. This is an 
  attempt at self-preservation as we try to limit the number of 
  platforms that we support. Note, however that we *still do not*
  support Java 1.5 language extensions (enum, enhanced for loop,
  generics, etc.) More info about that can be found here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=598
  If you find places in the code or reference that refer to Java 
  1.4 support, please let us know via dev.processing.org/bugs.

+ New XML Library
  We've switched to NanoXML instead of NanoXML-Lite. This means that 
  the export size of the XML library has changed from ~6k to ~30k. 
  The new version is much better at handling a broader range of XML
  content. The API should be the same and your code should work 
  without changes (unless you're playing with namespaces, in which 
  case those have to be specified differently). 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=757

+ Changes to how libraries are found
  Major bug fixing happened in handling the class path issues and 
  dealing with how libraries are loaded. With any luck, this should
  fix the dreaded aiexport bug. It should also give better results
  when multiple libraries are installed on the system. However, it 
  may mean that some libraries (or jarfiles) that shouldn't have 
  been working before will now (properly) no longer work.


[ minor enhancements ]

+ curveTangent() implemented by Dave Bollinger. (Thank you!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=715

+ Added support for quadratic (as opposed to just cubic) curves to 
  the Candy SVG library.

+ Altered Processing.app on Mac OS X to use the Quartz rendering 
  engine. In OS X 10.5, Apple switched renderers, which made most
  Processing sketches run considerably slower. Thanks Apple!

+ Added ctrl-/ to comment a block of code

+ Minor change to default window dimensions to support the Eee PC

+ Updated reference and slight reorganization to fix a handful of
  broken links. Moved the FAQ to the Processing site (no longer
  included in the download.)

+ Added a static version of saveStream() that uses a File object.

+ Add XMLElement (not filename) constructor to SVG lib
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=773


[ bug fixes ]

+ Color selector fixed by Francis Li. (Thanks!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=656

+ Net library no longer dies unceremoniously on ""Connection Refused""
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=751

+ Space after OPENGL param no longer breaks export
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=769

+ Fix ""noLoop()"" sketches unresponsive to exit request
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=694

+ Fixed bug with subset() when no length parameter was specified
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=707

+ Retired the long-standing TIFF in After Effects bug
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153

+ Fix for bezierTangent() problem from Dave Bollinger (Thanks!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=710

+ Fix problem with get() when imageMode(CORNERS) was in use

+ Fix bug with splice() and arrays
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=734

+ PImage mask now works after first call
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=744

+ Fix upside-down TGA files
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=742

+ Fix problem with g.smooth always returning false in JAVA2D
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=762


[ known new problems ] 

+ With the new runner setup, sketches sometimes won't start every 
  ~10th time or so (this will vary depending on your machine). 
  Hitting Run again should make things start up.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=775
  This may actually be a problem with Mac OS X sometimes not 
  launching Java. More recent Java releases for Mac OS X have 
  become less stable. If you see this on Windows, please let us
  know at the bug report.

ABOUT REV 0137 - 30 May 2008 ,,137,2008-05-30 00:00:00-04:00,"This release is an addendum to 0136, please read the notes on that
version if you have not already.

To be clear, we're moving to Java 1.5 for everything: the Processing 
environment and for sketches created with it. We don't have enough 
people to support it, and for a project of our size, we should be 
focusing on the future, rather than working around legacy Java code. 
In addition, Java 1.5 gives us access to better timing facilities 
which will improve the steadiness of animation.

The ""expert"" version for Windows has been discontinued temporarily, 
while we work out issues with the new runner setup. It may return
for a future release, but require a full JDK download, instead of 
just JRE as in the past.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Fix classpath problem with processing.exe. This was a 
  major flaw in 0136 prevented applications from running. 
  Not sure how this one made it out of Quality Control. 
  Today I'm gonna have to fire the guy who runs the 
  Processing Release Testing And Quality Assurance Center.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=780

+ Huge jar files when exporting with a code folder. 
  (Huge like the PDE trying to zip up everything on your disk.)

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=701
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=714

+ Fix support for the ""synchronized"" keyword in the preprocessor.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=136

[ changes ] 

+ Use multiple JAR files whenever
  1) a lib is in use, 2) code folder, 3) multiple files
  This will prevent MANIFEST collisions, especially when used
  with the code folder. 

+ Removed oro.jar dependency (not needed with PApplet.match())

+ Added improvements to the linux startup script contributed 
  by forum user 'neitsch'. (Thanks neitsch!)
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_core_pde;action=display;num=1202689238

+ Update preferences.txt whenever opening sketches. If you have
  to forcibly quit the application (as a certain P5 developer often 
  does), it will at least remember which sketches were running.

+ The openStream() method has been renamed to createInput(), and
  openStream() itself has been deprecated. This was actually done
  in 0136. In addition, a createOutput() method has been added 
  that creates an OutputStream.

ABOUT REV 0138 - 31 May 2008,,138,2008-05-31 00:00:00-04:00,"Continuing on the > 0135 crazy train.

[ regression repair ]

+ This fixes a major regression since 0135 where code would only run
  from the first sketch window opened. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=784

+ Fix ""expecting EOF, found ..."" error when importing a library.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=788

+ Remove debug spew when Export is used.

+ Switched to use Java 1.5 (not 1.5 or 1.6) for Processing.app 
  on Mac OS X. Hopefully this may avoid additional quirkiness.

[ graphics fix ]

+ Fix tessellation problems with concave 3D geometry that has many 
  nearby points (e.g. filled bezier polygons like fonts).
  Upgrade values to doubles, and multiply by 10 so that we can have
  some better accuracy as we tessellate. This seems to have negligible
  speed differences on Windows and Intel Macs, but causes a 50% speed
  drop for PPC Macs with the bug's example code that draws ~200 points
  in a concave polygon. Apple has abandoned PPC so we may as well too.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=774

[ fixed earlier ] 

+ The code folder was being ignored on export to application.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=469
  Fixed along with the changes in 0137.

[ new known issues ] 

+ Slow response on file, sketchbook, and examples menus
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786
  This may be limited to Mac OS X. The problem is more or less 
  known, just need to get a workaround in.

patch up some problems in the 0136+ series. If this is the first 
release you've downloaded since 0135, please read the ""ABOUT 013X""
sections for each of the releases since.

[ mixed bag of fixes ]

+ Highlighting of syntax errors was broken.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=795

+ The getIntAttribute() method from the XML library was 
  returning a float instead of an int.

  a Mac OS X application.

+ ""Target VM failed to initialize: VM initialization failed"" on run
  This happens because Java is not properly getting the machine's 
  internet address. Workaround is to shut off networking:

ABOUT REV 0140 - 10 June 2008,,140,2008-06-10 00:00:00-04:00,"Major changes (some might say improvements) to compilation and
platform-specific support. As with all releases later than 0135, 
this is essentially an alpha-quality release. We won't be making
them the default download until the series stabilizes. Please help
us out by testing this releases, and filing bugs in the bugs
database if you run into problems. 

If this is your first release since 0135, be sure to read *ALL* 
the releases notes in this file since that release. A lot has 
changed, and there are several known issues.

[ jikes/javac ] 

+ Jikes has been removed, and we are using Javac as the compiler. 
  The negative side of this is that compilation is a little slower,
  because Javac is kind of a dog. But that's outweighed by:
  - better compatability (avoiding quirky Jikes bugs)
  - ability to support Java 1.5 syntax (only in tabs that end in .java!)
  - no more Jikes binary problems on Linux (or elsewhere)
  - removing a binary from the download (less moving parts)

+ Error messages from Javac are very different, and it's quite
  likely that some aren't being handled properly. If you run into 
  this situation (on error messages--not warnings), please file
  a bug report, so that we can provide a better message to the 
  user about what's going on.

+ It is still not possible to use Java 1.5 syntax in Processing code
  from within the environment. You won't be able to use 1.5 syntax 
  until someone rewrites the preprocessor, which is a significant 
  undertaking. We want to do it soon, but it's a lot of work.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=598
  What has changed in release 0140 is that if you give a tab a name
  ending in "".java"", you'll be able to use 1.5 syntax, because that
  tab will not be run through the preprocessor. However, you'll also
  lose all Processing-specific syntax, and you'll have to pass the 
  PApplet object to any such class in order to use Processing API.
  (This is described in Help -> Getting Started.) And no, you cannot 
  make the main tab a .java file. You can always use Eclipse to do
  that, or better yet, give us a hand fixing Bug #598.

[ platform classes ]

+ Platform-specific code has been moved to separate sections of the 
  codebase. This simplifies how we connect to Mac OS X, Windows,
  and Linux. You no longer need the Apple support stubs to compile on 
  Windows and Linux, for one.

+ Windows registry calls are now handled using JNA, which is behaving
  far better than the old JNI Registry code that we had been using.
  This should also help internationalization significantly (the old
  code didn't properly handle Unicode, or multi-byte characters).

+ I have added Windows Vista and Ubuntu 8.04 on AMD64 to my testing
  routine. The apartment is really starting to look ridiculous, 
  and dinner guests probably won't be happening this Summer.

[ features/changes/fixes ]

+ With any luck we may have fixed the long-standing bug that prevents
  Processing from running on non-English systems with user accounts
  that contain non-ASCII characters. This is the target
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49
  However this has not yet been verified. Please test!

+ Apply two patches for ancient bugs in readBytesUntil() and bufferUntil() 
  in the serial library. Also fixes calls to serialEvent().
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=96
  (Thanks to stendahl and jmuhlich for the patches!)

+ Added a static version of loadBytes() that reads from a File object.

+ Slightly clearer error messages when OpenGL stuff is missing.

+ Removed sketchbook.fallback and settings.fallback from preferences.
  These cause more confusion/chaos/trouble than necessary.

+ Avoid an occasional division by zero when using the Create Font tool.

ABOUT REV 0141 - 11 June 2008,,141,2008-06-11 00:00:00-04:00,"This release fixes some issues found in the previous release, 
and changes to UTF-8 encoding when loading and saving sketches.
The latter is a major change, please read below.

While this release should be more stable than 0140, releases since
0135 may be closer to alpha quality. If this is your first release
since 0135, ** please read all the release notes below ** as there
have been many changes, and there are a handful of known bugs.

[ utf8 encoding ]

+ For better internationalization support, we've changed to UTF-8
  encoding when loading and saving sketches. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=743

+ Sketches that contain non-ASCII characters and were saved 
  with Processing 0140 and earlier may look strange when opened. 
  Garbled text and odd characters may appear where umlauts, 
  cedillas, and Japanese formerly lived. If this happens, 
  use the ""Fix Encoding & Reload"" option under the Tools menu. 
  This will reload your sketch using the same method as previous
  versions of Processing, at which point you can re-save it
  which will write a proper UTF-8 version.

+ Once you've converted a sketch to UTF-8, it will look similarly
  garbled if you use a release of Processing earlier than 0141. 

[ fixes and changes ] 

+ Hiding some unncessary warnings when compiling since they looked
  too much like errors. For instance, ""xxxx uses unsafe operations"", 
  and ""recompile with -Xlint:xxxx"".
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=817

+ Fix getChild() and getChildren() to properly handle namespaces 
  in the XML library.

ABOUT REV 0144 - 9 August 2008,,144,2008-08-09 00:00:00-04:00,"This is the first default download since release 0135. It represents 
several significant changes, so PLEASE READ ALL THE INFO BELOW FOR
REVISIONS 0136 through 0143 if this is the first version you're using
since 0135. We've also tried to update the documentation on 
processing.org, however with the number of things that have changed,
some things might be missed.

[ changes ] 

+ Updated reference and examples.

+ Unlike release 0135 and earlier, a full JDK (not just a JRE) is 
  required. I've added a test to see whether a proper JDK is installed.
  If not, it presents an error message and berates you for not heeding
  the repeated warnings to actually read this document. It also 
  permanently disables your privileges for downloading the ""expert"" 
  release of Processing that doesn't include Java. 

+ Added loadImageAsync(filename) and loadImageAsync(filename, ext).
  These functions load images on a separate thread so that your 
  sketch does not freeze while images load during setup(). While the
  image is loading, its width and height will be 0. If an error
  occurs while loading the image, its width and height will be set
  to -1. You'll know when the image has loaded properly because its
  width and height will be > 0. 

  Asynchronous image loading (particularly when downloading from a 
  server) drastically improves performance. In my case it was a 2-3x
  speedup when downloading 20 JPEG files that were ~3 MB apiece.

  An example of loading a single image in the background:

  PImage bigImage;
 
  void setup() {
    bigImage = loadImageAsync(""something.jpg"");
  }
 
  void draw() {
    if (bigImage.width == 0) {
      // image is not yet loaded
    } else if (bigImage.width == -1) {
      // this means an error occurred during image loading
    } else {
      // image is ready to go, draw it
      image(bigImage, 0, 0);
    }
  } 

  These functions do not yet have proper documentation, and their
  name is very likely to change in a future release before 1.0.
  I'm announcing them because some people will find them useful, 
  just keep an eye on revisions.txt for name changes.

+ Fixed a problem where OutOfMemoryErrors (as well as other more 
  catastrophic/complicated errors like StackOverflowError) were not 
  reported. These are now reported along with additional explanation
  in the editor console.

+ Better error messages for OpenGL quirks. 

+ Improve efficiency of directionalLight and pointLight with OpenGL.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1199376364

+ Incorporate changes to better support Andres Colubri's improved
  OpenGL graphics library.

+ Slight modification to name handling in the XML library. This makes
  existing code behave closer to the older XML library found in 0135.
  For those using 0136+, getFullName() has been changed to getName(),
  and getName() to getLocalName().

+ Added indent/outdent feature to the Edit menu. Also updated the 
  right-click context menu for the editor to incorporate more of the
  recent additions to the Edit menu.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Don't open more than one copy of the Preferences window.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=830

+ Fixed a problem where bad image data would make image loading fail
  without an error message. The only indication of it breaking was
  that the width and height of the image would be -1. The latter is 
  still the case, but an error message is printed to the console.

+ Added imageMode(CENTER). Or rather, brought it back from the 0070s.

+ Greatly improve exception handling and parsing through the use of a 
  proper implementation and the removal of a large amount of duct tape.

+ Fix and finalize previously unannounced, unmentioned (untouchable)
  functions that prompt the user for a file to open, a location to save 
  a file, or select a folder. The functions each return a String object 
  (or null for no selection) and are called selectInput(), selectOutput(), 
  and selectFolder(). No parameters are necessary, but an optional 
  parameter allows you to specify the user prompt. For instance:
  String loadPath = selectInput(""What file ya want?"");
  String savePath = selectOutput(""Save this masterpiece as..."");
  String folderPath = selectFolder(""Which folder has the good stuff?"");

+ Use actual sketch name when running instead of Temporary_NNNN_NNNN.

+ Make the Processing icon show up in external windows (Windows and Linux).
  Also set the window title (and dock title on OS X) for sketches.

This release contains fixes for compatability with the GLGraphics
library and documentation about the Tools menu.

With any luck, this will be the last release for at least a week.

[ changes ] 

+ Some additions have been made to the internal API to support the
  GLGraphics library, which is incompatible with the last few releases. 
  You'll still need to download a new version of the library that's 
  compatible with this release (0148) of Processing.

+ Cleaned up internal API for proper interfaces with user-contributed
  items for the Tools menu. 

+ A ""tools"" folder has been added, which includes a howto.txt file that
  explains how to build your own tools. Note that like libraries, 
  contributed tools should be stored in the sketchbook. (See the
  howto.txt files in ""libraries"" and ""tools"" for more information.)

+ An example Tool with source and a build script is included. (However
  it's not compiled by default, so you won't see it in the menu.) 
  Future releases may put all items from the Tools menu into the 
  default ""tools"" folder with source (just like the libraries).

ABOUT REV 0149 - 15 October 2008,,149,2008-10-15 00:00:00-04:00,"Very large number of bug fixes and changes. All renderers that use 
PGraphics will need to be updated for this release. That means you'll
need a new GLGraphics, P5Sunflow, etc. Lots of libraries will need to
be updated for 0149.

Important! library and tool folders have changed--see notes below.

This release also adds command-line support, which means that Processing
can be integrated into all manner of environments. More info below.

Also many, many updates to the examples and reference in this release.

* RELEASES SINCE 0135 CONTAIN MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, PLEASE READ *
*  THE NOTES IN THIS FILE FOR ANY RELEASE THAT YOU'VE NOT YET USED. *

[ libraries & tools ]

+ Beginning with this release, all libraries should be placed in the sketchbook
  folder, inside a folder called ""libraries"". It's a bad idea to put them in
  the Processing libraries folder, because 1) users may not have access to that
  folder in lab environments, and 2) it's now hidden on OS X (see below).

+ Also in this release, all tools should be placed in a folder named ""tools"" 
  inside your sketchbook folder. Same reasons as above.

[ launchers ]

+ The Mac OS X release is now a single .app file, simplifying the install and
  bringing us into closer Steve compliance.

+ The Windows release has a new launcher based on a hacked/tweaked version 
  of launch4j-3.0.1, an excellent app bundling tool for Windows. Many thanks
  to its developer(s) for their hard work. http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

+ Fixed a Windows problem with the JDK not being found, even when installed.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=878

+ Fixed a problem with older/badder JDKs being used on Windows.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=545

+ Made PDE files double-clickable on Windows.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=683
  By default we now set the registry associations to launch the most recently
  run version of processing.exe (it must be called that, at least for now)
  when a .pde file is double-clicked. The behavior can be disabled in the
  Preferences dialog.

+ With the new launcher, we even have a splash screen (the about box) that
  shows up while Java is roused from bed.

[ changes ] 

+ Changed how PGraphics objects are created for better consistency. Sadly, 
  this will require any libraries that subclass PGraphics to be rebuilt 
  for this release. (However, internally it's a great improvement.) 
  Renderer library authors please read the reference for PGraphics:
  http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PGraphics.html
  For library developers, a gritty list of the internal function changes 
  can be found in processing/core/done.txt in the revision 0149 section under 
  the heading ""PGraphics API changes"". (It's not poetic, but it's real.)

+ We've decided that vector geometry is as important as image data, so the
  Candy library has been removed, and replaced by a built-in loadShape()
  method in PApplet, which returns a PShape object. (Candy lives on as the
  PShapeSVG class, which is the PShape subclass created by loadShape.)
  A shape() command has been added (like the image() command for images). 
  See the new SVG examples for more information. In the future, we'd like 
  to support other vector formats (such as OBJ) with loadShape(), or 
  provide a means for libraries to register themselves to load shape data.

+ The PShape object is just a container for now, but will someday provide
  methods for accessing actual vertex information. 

+ Because of the SVG changes, the XML library is now built into the core.
  This means that processing.xml will be imported by default (no need for 
  ""import processing.xml"" in your sketch). This also means that ""XML""
  will no longer be seen in the ""Import Library"" menu.

+ Altered how createInput(), save(), and saveFrame() work so that they
  are more friendly to signed applets.

+ Implemented new error/warning system inside PGraphics so that errors
  are only shown once, and non-fatal errors do not shut down the sketch.

+ The unhint() method has been removed, see the hint() reference for changes.

+ Changed how match() works to bring back in line with other regexp
  implementations. Instead of only returning matching groups, match 0
  is the matching sequence, and array elements [1] and higher represent 
  each of the groups (sequences found in parens). This brings us into 
  compliance with how ""everyone else"" does it. Please direct complaints, 
  jeers, or accolades to Dan Shiffman, who advocated the change.

+ Also starting in this release, the match() commands use multiline 
  matching (Pattern.MULTILINE) and dotall mode (Pattern.DOTALL) by default 
  so that ^ and $ match the beginning and end of any lines found in the 
  source, and the . operator will also pick up newline characters.

+ The arraycopy() method is now arrayCopy(), for better consistency with 
  the rest of the API (think framerate vs. frameRate). Because books have
  been printed with the lowercase version, we're keeping both, but in 
  Java parlance, we've deprecated the lowercase version.

+ Removed MACOS9 constant from processing.core.PConstants. Bye bye 2001.

+ Deprecated the NORMALIZED constant, use NORMAL instead.

+ Removed some items from the default imports because they're 1) likely
  to cause naming collisions and 2) more likely to be used by advanced 
  users (who can add 'em themselves anyway). The removed items include:
  javax.sound.midi,javax.sound.midi.spi,
  javax.sound.sampled,javax.sound.sampled.spi,
  javax.xml.parsers,javax.xml.transform,javax.xml.transform.dom,
  javax.xml.transform.sax,javax.xml.transform.stream,
  org.xml.sax,org.xml.sax.ext,org.xml.sax.helpers
  You can add default imports to your preferences.txt file by adding to
  the preproc.imports line. But keep in mind that this will make your 
  code incompatible with Processing on any machine that doesn't have 
  its preferences.txt mangled in the same manner.

+ Update Quaqua to 4.4.7 on Mac OS X (http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/)

+ Disable abyssmally slow Sun renderer on OS X 10.5, by setting 
  apple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz to true inside PApplet.main().

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Prevent caps/joins from throwing an error and halting the render. 
  This was a problem when drawing SVG files with OpenGL:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=628
  However, complex shapes or shapes with holes will produce an error in OpenGL:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=947

  exporting a sketch on Linux. (Regression since ~0140)

+ Make parseFloat() with String[] array return NaN for missing values

+ Hopefully fixed a ""transport error 202"" error.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=895

+ hint(DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST) now clears the depth buffer so that there's no
  longer a need for a kludgey workaround (messing with g.zbuffer or dropping
  into OpenGL code to call gl.glClear(GL.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT))
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=827

+ Header not always updating on rename... this was an old bug that hasn't
  been seen or confirmed recently, closing it.

+ PVector is a simple 3-dimensional vector (x, y, z) or point class, 
  based on code from Dan Shiffman. No more roll-your-own vectorishness.

+ PMatrix interface, along with PMatrix2D (3x2 affine) and PMatrix3D (4x4)
  implementations for use with the renderers (and your own code). 

+ Added matchAll() method, which is identical to match(), except that 
  it returns an array of all matches in the specified String, rather 
  than just the first. (Thanks to Dan Shiffman for the implementation.)

+ Add new ""Getting Started"" to the help menu
  http://processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/
  The old Getting Started item has been renamed to ""Environment"".

+ Added getImage() method to PImage, which returns it as a java.awt.Image.
  (Actually it's a BufferedImage, but who's keeping track?)

+ Added a note to prefs dialog that multiple jar export only works w/o libs
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=907

[ known problems ]

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5. This is 
  an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5 causing these menus 
  to be extremely slow. With Apple's Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 7, 
  they appear to have successfully backported the bug to OS X 10.4. 
  Hooray! Now it affects both 10.4 and 10.5. Much success to them for 
  their help. Some workarounds are described in the bug report:

  blue line across image in saveFrame(). This also affected any other pixel
  operations in OpenGL, because it was breaking loadPixels().

[ changes / additions ] 

+ Your childhood friend the smooth() command is returning to P3D. Right now 
  internal lines of shapes may be visible when smoothing is enabled in P3D, 
  but that will be fixed in a future release.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=957

+ Crazy old Uncle Strokeweight is also returning to P3D, however he still 
  hasn't turned himself around and retains his old baggage:

  With P2D, P3D, and OPENGL, series of connected lines (such as the stroke 
  around a polygon, triangle, or ellipse) produce unattractive results when 
  strokeWeight is set.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=955

  When used with P3D, strokeWeight does not interpolate the Z-coordinates 
  of the lines, which means that when rotated, these flat lines may 
  disappear. (Since, uh, lines are, you know, flat.) The OPENGL renderer 
  setting does not share this problem because it always draws lines 
  perpendicular to the screen (which we hope to do in a future release).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=956

  The original strokeWeight() bug, which also contains a code 
  example for those wanting to do their own thick line code:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123

+ Removed the error dialog that popped up to nag about sketch naming, 
  now we're only writing it to the console. 

+ Library authors note that the dimensional() method in PGraphics has been 
  split into is2D() and is3D() for better congruence with use.

[ cannot fix ]

+ Some file dialogs on Linux produce a stream of error chatter to the
  console. This has been identified as a Sun bug. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=951

[ regression ]

+ OpenGL rendering is more dim/darker in release 0149 and later.

ABOUT REV 0152 - 19 October 2008,,152,2008-10-19 00:00:00-04:00,"Read the release notes for revision 0149! There were major changes to 
library installation, and the Candy and XML libraries have been moved.

This release contains a bug fix, and now includes Damien Di Fede's 
excellent Minim audio library as part of the download. (Thanks!)

I neglected to mention in the 0151 release notes that the polygon smoothing
work was brought back from the alpha releases by Eric Jordan who re-integrated
the code into the more recent source and added proper perspective correction
and smoothing for textures. Many thanks to ewjordan!

[ changes ] 

+ Unlike Candy, you can no longer use shape.width and shape.height to get
  the dimensions of an object. To get the width and height of a PShape, 
  use getWidth() and getHeight(). We neglected to include these in the
  PShape/loadShape reference. The reason for the change is that sometimes
  time-consuming calculations will be required to figure out the dimensions 
  of a shape.

+ Fix get() when used with save() in OpenGL mode

+ Immediately update projection with OpenGL. In the past, projection
  updates required a new frame. This also prevents camera/project from
  being reset when the drawing size is changed.

+ Removed an error that caused the cameraNear value to be set to -8.

PROCESSING REV 0176 - 20 February 2010,,176,2010-02-20 00:00:00-05:00,"Android changes are at the top, changes for the rest of Processing are listed
below that (a tipoff being that there's no PDF library on Android...)

[ android ]

+ Minimum platform support is changing to 2.0 instead of 1.6. That means
  ""Eclair"" or later, and goodbye to my T-Mobile G1, undoubtedly the ugliest
  cell phone I have ever owned. Hello to Droid and Nexus One.
  Performance is very poor on pre-2.0 devices anyway.

+ Known issue: Sketches that use noLoop() are currently broken.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1467

+ Added support for libraries and the code folder.

+ Classes have moved to the processing.core package instead of
  processing.android.core.

+ Slashes in the SDK path are now escaped properly on Windows.

+ Fix problems preventing Android Mode from running on Windows
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1432

+ The tint() method now works.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1435

+ loadFont() and text() now work properly. createFont() has not been tested.

[ changes ]

+ Lots of edits to the HTML that's used for exported applets. If JavaScript
  is enabled, Sun's new loading functions are used, which offer the best
  compatibility across browsers. If not, the old loading method is used.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1057

+ Changed the OpenGL HTML template to load differently, which should fix a
  NullPointerException in JOGLAppletLanucher with Java 6 Update 18 on Windows,
  and should also be more efficient altogether, because the JOGL libraries can
  be downloaded just once from Sun, rather than for each sketch that uses them.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1452

+ Code from Takachin that handles full input method support in the editor for
  Japanese and other scripts that are more complicated than Roman text.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=854
  Thanks Takachin!

+ Downgraded the PDF library to use iText 1.5.4, because later versions seem
  to load slower, and don't seem to offer additional benefits. If the PDF
  library gets worse, please post a bug and we'll go back to the 2.x release
  we were using, or upgrade to the more recent 5.x series.

+ Changed how imports are handled in sketches. This may break some sketches
  that use java.xxx packages that aren't covered in the Processing reference.

+ With great help from Hansi, moved the build scripts over to Ant.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
  Also moved the special JRE for Linux and Windows out of SVN. It'll only be
  downloaded when 'ant dist' is run. This makes the build and maintenance
  more of a mess for me, but will save me from people whining about the
  large files.

+ Javadoc is slowly improving. More on that later.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Updated JNA to version 3.2.4 to support Windows 7 64-bit
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1424
  Thanks to Maik for tracking down the problem and solution!

+ Fix from taifun_browser to handle texture memory leak with OpenGL and P3D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1423

+ Hitting ESC inside Color Selector would quit Processing
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1006

+ To fix video, and some other libraries on Snow Leopard, exported applications
  are now explicitly set to run 32-bit on OS X.

+ Fix LITERAL_class so that blah.class syntax can be used in PDE code.
  Found and fixed by Christian Thiemann. Thank you!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1466

+ Fix from Chris Lonnen to lock the minimum size for the main processing editor
  frame. (When too small, the console would disappear, etc.) Thanks Chris!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25

+ If you overwrite PApplet.main(), you're responsible for what happens.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1446

[ keys ]

+ Added ctrl-ins, shift-ins, shift-delete for cut/copy/paste on Windows and
  Linux, but disabled by default on Mac OS X. You can change the setting by
  altering ""editor.keys.alternative_cut_copy_paste"" in preferences.txt.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162

+ Changed shift-backspace to just mean backspace, rather than delete. You
  can change back to the old behavior by setting this entry in preferences.txt:
  editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete = true
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1463

+ Added an option for home and end keys traveling to the start/end of the
  current line rather than the beginning/ending of a sketch. The latter is
  the HIG default for Mac OS X, but drives some people nuts. Change with:
  editor.keys.home_and_end_travel_far = false

[ fonts ]

+ Starting in this release, the createFont() method will only load characters
  as they are used, which should greatly improve the font situation on
  non-Roman systems like Japanese. This will use far less memory, and should
  be all around much more efficient. Formerly, createFont() took several
  seconds to run, depending on the speed of your system.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1111

+ Fixed a problem with the Create Font tool ignoring the 'smooth' setting
  on some systems.

+ Fixed a separate problem with the createFont() method also ignoring the
  'smooth' setting.

+ With the Create Font tool, you can also specify what Unicode character
  blocks you'd like to use, making a much smaller font.

+ Fonts are no longer power of 2 by default. This should also make them more
  memory efficient. With future OpenGL updates, this will work even better.

all of the changes from all the interim revisions, with the exception of the
changes for the upcoming Android tools, which are not enabled in this release.

Lots of bug fixes over 1.0.9, and several changes that improve how fonts are
handled. Because of the large number of changes (and that some functionality
actually changes, if that's actually a word), this is release 1.1 instead
of release 1.0.10. Which is nice, because release 1.0.10 sounds baffling.

[ font changes ]

+ It's no longer necessary to use textFont() before text() and other
  text-handling functions. The default ""SansSerif"" font is used, which
  varies by platform.

+ Also in this release, the createFont() method will only load characters
  as they are used, which should greatly improve the font situation on
  non-Roman systems like Japanese. This will use far less memory, and should
  be all around much more efficient. Formerly, createFont() took several

problems caused by Apple's Update 2 for Java on OS X, so this should make
Processing usable on Macs again.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix for Apple bug that caused an assertion failure when requestFocus()
  was called in some situations. This was causing the PDE to become unusable
  for opening sketches, and focus highlighting was no longer happening.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=258
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1564
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1569

+ Fixed two bugs with fonts created with specific charsets.

+ Fix from jdf for PImage(java.awt.Image img) and ARGB images
  public PImage(java.awt.Image) was setting the format to RGB (even if ARGB)

+ Large number of beginShape(POINTS) not rendering correctly on first frame
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1572

+ Fix for PDF library and createFont() on Linux, thanks to Matthias Breuer.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1566

+ Fix from takachin for a problem with full-width space with Japanese IME.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1531

+ Reset matrix for the PDF library in-between frames
  also added begin/endDraw between frames
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1227

[ additions ]

+ Add the changes for ""Copy as HTML"" to replace the ""Copy for Discourse""
  function, now that we've shut down the old YaBB discourse board.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=271

+ Option to disable re-opening sketches when you start Processing.
  The default will stay the same, but if you don't like the feature,
  alter your preferences.txt file to change:
  last.sketch.restore=true
  to the following:
  last.sketch.restore=false
  The issue was originally filed here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1501
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=245
  However the main problem with this is that due to other errors, the wrong
  sketches are being opened, sketches are sometimes forgotten, or windows
  are opened concurrently on top of one another, creating a bad situation:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=177
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=179
  Those bugs are not yet fixed, but will be addressed in future releases.

+ Option to change the default naming of sketches via preferences.txt.
  First, you can change the prefix, which defaults to:
  editor.untitled.prefix=sketch_
  And the suffix is handled using dates. The current default (since 1.0) is:
  editor.untitled.suffix=MMMdd
  Or if you want to switch back to the old (six digit) style, you could use:
  editor.untitled.suffix=yyMMdd
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1091

+ Updated bundled JRE/tools to 6u20 for Windows and Linux

+ Several SVG fixes and additions, including some tweaks from PhiLho. These
  changes will be documented in a future release once the API changes are
  complete.

+ Added option to launch a sketch directly w/ linux. Thanks to Larry Kyrala.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1549

+ Pass actual exceptions from InvocationTargetException in registered
  methods, which improves how exceptions are reported with libraries.

+ Added loading.gif to the js version of the applet loader. Not sure
  if this is actually working or not, but it's there.

[ android ]

+ Added permissions for INTERNET and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to the default
  AndroidManifest.xml file. This will be addressed in greater detail here:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=275
  And with the implementation of code signing here:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=222

+ Lots of work happening underneath with regards to Android, more updates
  soon as things start evening out a bit.

+ Defaulting to a WVGA screen for the default Processing AVD.

[ additions ]

+ On Mac OS X, you're no longer required to have a sketch window open at
  all times. This will make the application feel more Mac-like--a little
  more elegant and trendy and smug with superiority.

+ Added a warning to the Linux version to tell users that they should be
  using the official version of Java from Sun if they're not.
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms#Linux
  There isn't a perfect way to detect whether Sun Java is in use,

+ Fixed a problem when using command-line arguments with exported sketches
  on Windows. Thanks to davbol for the fix.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=303

+ Added requestFocusInWindow() call to replace Apple's broken requestFocus(),
  which should return the previous behavior of sketches getting focus
  immediately when loaded in a web browser.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=279

+ Add getDocumentBase() version of createInput() for Internet Explorer.
  Without this, sketches will crash when trying to find files on a web server
  that are not in the exported .jar file. This fix is only for IE. Yay IE!

are some problems with fonts. If you're using text, especially with PDFs,
you may want to wait until the next release.

Android users should read the Wiki (http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android)
which has a lot of new information.

[ android ]

+ Added a new menu to cover enabling/disabling Android mode.

+ Added a Permissions dialog, so that you can set permissions for your
  applications, e.g. so you can read from the internet or save files.

+ Added support for icons. Put files named icon-32.png, icon-48.png,
  and icon-72.png in your sketch folder, and they'll be added to your
  project when it's created. Otherwise you'll get an ugly blue dot
  default icon. You've been warned.

+ Finish implementing the size() command on Android. See the Wiki for notes.

+ Fixed how the manifest file is read/written.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1429
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=221

+ Copied the XML and font changes from the desktop version of core.

+ Removing 'import processing.opengl.*' in the preprocessor, since it's
  not needed, and will cause a conflict.

+ Added functions to lock orientation if necessary. Use:
  orientation(LANDSCAPE) and orientation(PORTRAIT) if you need control.

+ createGraphics() works with A3D/P3D/OPENGL for phones that support it.

[ core ]

+ Changed skewX/Y to shearX/Y.

+ ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS was being ignored, native fonts were always used
  in some cases. However, this broke some other things. But that's why
  this is a pre-release, not a final.

[ xml fixes and changes ]

+ Changed the XML constructor to take a String for a node name, instead of
  parsing a document from a String. Instead, use XMLElement.parse(String)
  if you want to read a file.

+ Added getBoolean() methods.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=304

PROCESSING REV 0192 - 18 December 2010,,192,2010-12-18 00:00:00-05:00,"This release contains a roll-up of lots of bug fixes. However, it's being
released before it's ready, so it should only be used by people who are having
trouble with the new Android SDK release (revision 8) from Google, which
broke Android support last week.

This version of Processing for Android *requires* Android SDK Tools Release 8.
If you're not using release 8, and don't have the necessary components
installed, you'll get (confusing) error messages saying that the SDK location
is not set, and that it could not find an SDK in the location that you specify.

As for this being an early release, the problem is that major changes were
underway regarding how libraries are handled, so it's quite possible that
library support (in both the standard or Android version) or code folder
support is somewhat broken. So with that caveat, no whining, please.

On a happier note, the changes:

[ android fixes ]

+ Compile android-core with Java 5 as the target so that it works on OS X 10.5.

[ additions from andres ]

PROCESSING REV 0193 - 8 March 2011,,193,2011-03-08 00:00:00-05:00,"The PDE is receiving a major overhaul. The most obvious change is that
there's now a menu that allows you to switch between ""modes"". ""Standard""
is the Java-based mode that we're all used to, and ""Android"" compiles
things for Android devices.

Basically it's all pre-releases from here until 2.0.

With the mode support, it will soon be possible to embed other projects,
like the Python version, or the JS exporter, directly inside the PDE.
More on this later.

This release also fixes a handful of Android problems, like the use of
libraries, the code folder, and so on.

[ core ]

+ Fix problem that made applets suck in Google Chrome and Firefox 4.

+ Fix java.lang.OutOfMemoryError using get() and image() inside a tight loop.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=42

+ Changed default font to Lucida Sans, available on all platforms.
  This means that your text may be a slightly different size if you haven't
  used textFont(), but hey, you probably don't use the default font, right?
  A fella (or gal) like you?

+ textAlign() incorrect with default font on Mac OS X 10.6
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=362

+ Clean up how PDF fonts are handled. Default to writing fonts as shapes,
  which makes PDF files larger, but is likely to work in more cases. If you
  want editable/real text, you can call textMode(MODEL) right after creating
  the PDF renderer (directly below size() or beginRecord()).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=416

+ Saving a PGraphics as jpg using save() makes a cmyk file
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=415

+ Fix bizarre window placement when using Present mode on OS X.

[ pde changes/fixes ]

+ Added support for separate 32 and 64 bit versions of libraries.

+ Added a 64 bit version of the OpenGL library.

+ Updates to Java 6u23 in the download.

+ Fix issue with javac.exe not being included in the download.

+ Also added opengl2, which rolls GLGraphics and the new Android OpenGL
  library into a newer, faster, more amazinger OpenGL that will eventually
  be the default.

+ Added a *lot* of examples. This has also had the effect of making the
  download enormous. It's currently obese. We'll sort that out later.

+ Code folder oddity on application export (in SVN)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=486

+ Processing cannot run because it could not ... store your settings.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=410

+ AutoFormat unecessarily adds spaces to function with multiple args
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=462

+ Fix for linux build script (thanks to Kevin Keraudren)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=466

+ Fix the encoding on OS X for the ""Fix Encoding and Reload"" function

+ Hex value from color picker does not start with #
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=529

+ Console, preferences cleanup: removed build.path, as well as
  console.output.file, and console.error.file. Also removed 'console'
  true/false from preferences.

+ Change console to write to the 'console/' folder in settings.
  This may eventually create a problem with logs that need to be cleaned,
  but we'll keep an eye on it for now.

+ Add splash image on OS X.

+ Added window for examples. It's a bit ugly, but the menu was too much
  and we should be able to clean this feller up later. Also makes the
  examples a bit more obvious.

+ Updated the serial library for Mac OS X

[ android edits ]

+ Add better icons from Casey for exported applications.

+ Remove the need to download the android core.jar separately
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=421

+ Remove the Google APIs requirement, just use the standard.
  This means losing the standard skin on the emulator, but we'll see
  about bringing it back in some other fashion in the future.
  We weren't actually using the Google APIs, so it seemed silly
  because of how much complexity it added.

+ Deal with issue of debug certificates expiring.

+ With mode support, ""Run on Device"" and ""Run in Emulator"" instead of
  ""Run"" and ""Present"".

[ internal changes ]

+ Removed build.path from preferences.txt.
  Not really used anywhere, just trying to clean things up.

+ Removed 'console.output.file' and 'console.error.file'.
  These weren't respected as paths, no reason for them.

+ Change console to write to the 'console/' folder in settings.
  This may eventually create a problem with logs that need to be cleaned,
  but we'll keep an eye on it for now.

+ Removed 'console' true/false from preferences.

+ Cannot reproduce problem with wrong character encoding in the console.

PROCESSING REV 0194 - 9 March 2011,,194,2011-03-09 00:00:00-05:00,"Lots of fixes for late-breaking problems in release 0193.

[ fixes ]

+ The Auto Format command went missing in 0193. It's back for 0194, but is
  now located in the Edit menu, where it will stay for the rest of its long
  and happy life.

+ The ""Import Library"" menu wasn't being updated properly in 0193. Note that
  for the time being, there are no core libraries on Android. (OpenGL is built
  in, for instance.)

+ Fix mode switching for Windows and Linux.

+ Library examples weren't showing up in 0193, now they're back.

+ Fix for flicker problem in the default renderer.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=558

+ The examples menu wasn't completely removed in 0193.

+ Remove ""temporarily skipping deletion of"" debugging message on export.

+ Properly reload examples & libraries when changing the sketchbook location.

+ Fix a problem with untitled sketches and mode switching.

+ Fix problem with Sketch Permissions for Android.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=559

[ notes ]

+ Because both OpenGL and OpenGL2 are present, there may be conflicts if you
  implement any OpenGL-specific code outside the Processing API. If your sketch
  includes either of the following lines:

  import javax.media.opengl.*;
  import javax.media.opengl.glu.*;

  then you should remove one of the OpenGL libraries, depending on which you
  would like to use.

+ OpenGL is built-in on Android. You don't need to add it as a library, the
  way you do with the desktop. A ""import processing.opengl.*"" line won't
  hurt anything (the preprocessor removes it), but it's also not necessary.
  (This is also noted in the Android wiki.)

+ Library examples no longer show up buried in the sketchbook. Instead they
  can be found in the ""Libraries"" and ""Contributed Libraries"" sections of
  the examples window.

[ additions ]

+ Added a new icon for ""Export to Application"", along the lines of the
  icons used on the Android side.

+ Remove warning about the broken build.

PROCESSING 1.5 (REV 0196) - 17 April 2011,1.5,196,2011-04-17 00:00:00-04:00,"A lot has changed in the nine months since 1.2.1 was released, the biggest
being the introduction of ""modes"" for the editor, allowing you to switch
between Android development or the classic desktop/web mode. More modes are
coming in future releases.

Another significant change is a fix for applets that were stuttering or
appearing to run very, very slowly in Firefox 4 and Chrome. That's the major
reason that we're releasing this version in advance on 2.0 later this summer.

All of the changes since 1.2.1 are listed in this document. If you get stuck,
give it a search to see if there might be a clue about something that has
changed. Or if you have problems, please file a bug.

For people who have been using OPENGL2 in the pre-releases, the library
has been removed from 1.5, and will return in future pre-releases before
eventually replacing the built-in OpenGL library for 2.0.

Meanwhile, here are the changes since revision 0195, the last pre-release:

This release is primarily focused on the new video library and making it
usable across platforms. It also has some changes for how applications
are exported, and a number of other bug fixes and tweaks.

[ platforms ]

+ With this release, Java 1.6 is now required. We will no longer be
  supporting Java 1.5.

+ In perhaps related news, we are no longer supporting Mac OS X 10.5.
  We have to support 10.6 and 10.7 across both 32- and 64-bit, and adding
  yet another to that is simply not possible.

[ 32- and 64-bit support is a nightmare ]

+ A great deal of effort is being put into supporting the emergence of
  64-bit. Library support has changed significantly to get things working,
  more on this coming soon.

+ Serial on Mac OS X and Windows is currently only available for 32-bit.
  Hoping someone can help us support a 64-bit version sometime soon.

+ When exporting a 64-bit application for Windows, a .bat file is created,
  because our .exe doesn't yet support 64-bit. Assuming you have a 64-bit
  JVM installed, the .bat file should load things properly.

+ Because serial only supports 32-bit on OS X, exporting an application
  that uses serial will only create a application.macosx32 folder, which
  is a 32-bit app for Mac OS X. No application.macosx64 will be created,
  nor will a universal application.macosx folder. This is also the case
  for other libraries that have only 32- or 64-bit support. See earlier
  note that 32- and 64-bit support is an f*ing nightmare.

[ video ]

+ The most significant change in this release is that the new video library
  from Andres (based on his old gsvideo library) is nearing fully fucntional.

+ MovieMaker is going to be replaced by a Tool that allows you to sequence
  a set of images together into a movie file. The tool currently has a GUI
  bug that breaks it, but this will be fixed sometime soon.

[ other changes ]

+ Application is now the default export (instead of Applet).

+ Change to how dataPath() and dataFile() work. This is an undocumented
  function, but for those using it, here's the skinny:

  dataPath() is only available with applications, not applets or Android.
  On Windows and Linux, this is simply the data folder, which is located
  in the same directory as the EXE file and lib folders. On Mac OS X, this
  is a path to the data folder buried inside Contents/Resources/Java.
  For the latter point, that also means that the data folder should not be
  considered writable. Use sketchPath() for now, or inputPath() and
  outputPath() once they're available in the 2.0 release.

  dataPath() is not supported with applets because applets have their data
  folder wrapped into the JAR file. To read data from the data folder that
  works with an applet, you should use other methods such as createInput(),
  createReader(), or loadStrings().

+ Additional library files included with application exports are now placed
  in the 'lib' folder on Linux and Windows, or buried inside the OS X app.
  This helps prevent the unsightly mess of DLLs that were crowding the
  root folder of exported applications on Windows and Linux.

+ If noLoop() has been called but a sketch is resized, redraw() will be
  called to update the screen.

Chicago a little longer. A handful of bug fixes here:

+ Video capture was broken in 2.0a3 on OS X due to an issue with the build
  process. Should be all set now.

+ Fixed incessant ""inefficient font rendering"" debug message on Android.

+ Fixed android/code/build.xml to point at the correct SDK version.

+ Changing between 32- and 64- bit mode on OS X wasn't properly reloading
  library paths. Now it should pick up the necessary 32- and 64-bit version
  of a library that's needed. (However there are still no useful error
  messages when natives aren't available for the platform--just an
  UnsatisfiedLinkError when you try to run. Will fix.)

fixes and additions as we head toward 2.0.

Unfortunately, however, Android mode is still broken on Windows.
http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1022

On the OpenGL front, we're working to have a single library that works
across both desktop and mobile, which is good news because it means we have
a fighting chance of making it work (rather than maintaining two entire sets
of a very complicated set of code), but the downside is that it requires
newer versions of OpenGL on both the desktop and mobile, so it may cause
problems with old OSes, mediocre graphics drivers, etc that worked with
earlier releases.

+ Don't show library conflict warning until someone tries to build
  with code that actually calls on one of those packages.

+ urlEncode() and urlDecode() added (docs coming later).

+ delay() is back again. F*king delay().

PROCESSING 2.0a7 (REV 0206) - 29 July 2012,2.0a7,206,2012-07-29 00:00:00-04:00,"Hopefully the last alpha before we hit 2.0 beta.

The big change is that we're dropping support for applets in 2.0, and in
this release. See the Changes section of the Wiki for details. We've not
updated all of the documentation to reflect this yet.

OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion support has also been added, by virtue of our
paying $99/year for the privilege of releasing our free and open source
application on OS X. When run on 10.8, versions prior to 2.0a7 would report
that they were corrupt, invalid, or not trusted. Which is definitely us.

[ editor ]

+ Implemented a ""Recent Sketches"" menu. This replaces re-opening
  sketches on startup, which behaved inconsistently anyway.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=188

+ Use Swing file choosers by default on Linux. The default open/save
  dialogs provided by Java are pretty gruesome, so we're switching to
  the Swing JFileChooser instead. To swap the behavior, set
  'chooser.files.native' in your preferences.txt file.

+ Suppress ""invalid context 0x0"" and ""invalid drawable"" because they're
  (unfixable) Apple Java bugs and being reported as Processing bugs.
  Also suppress XInitThreads message on Linux with JOGL, which is a
  JOGL bug that'll hopefully be fixed in their next release.

+ Fix Movie Maker tool on OS X.

+ Update to Java 6 update 33 on Windows and Linux.

+ Add separate 32- and 64-bit releases for Windows and Linux. Lots of other
  updates for 32/64-bit support in general.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=955

+ Replace processing.exe with a more standard version from launch4j,
  which should hopefully clean up some launcher issues.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=943
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=176

+ Change how sketches open so that there's no longer differences between
  the File menu 'Open' and the way it worked from the toolbar. Simplifies
  additional code that was quirky.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1034

+ Add a warning dialog for libraries that aren't compatible.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=884

+ Fix up the file choosers used on Linux.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1014

+ Instead of prompting for sketchbook location on Linux, just default to
  a folder named 'sketchbook' in the user's home directory. This can easily
  be changed later but simplifies things internally a bit.

+ No longer allow underscore at beginning of sketch name (causes problems
  with Android, and also with applets, though we care less about those...)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1047

+ Fixed a problem where sanitized names (underscores replacing unusable
  characters) could potentially overwrite existing folders.

[ core ]

+ Major changes to selectInput(), selectOutput(), and selectFolder().
  See the Wiki: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Changes#Change_and_Removed
  The changes are there to prevent a threading bug:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=173
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=931
  And also include an option to set the default file path:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=233

+ Change 'appletViewer' back to 'online'. Still deprecated, especially
  because applets are going away.

+ Add begin/endGL added to PGraphics/PApplet.

+ Add hasChildren() to XML library.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1045

+ Fix where displayWidth/Height not being set properly before setup()
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1120

+ XML now throws exceptions in its constructor (for advanced users).
  Use loadXML() instead of ""new XML(this, ....)""
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1138

+ loadXML() returns null when the file did not open properly
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1138

+ ortho() causing line and fill to be misaligned
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1143

+ Add some extra options for PApplet.main() for advanced users:
  PApplet.main(""SketchName"") and PApplet.main(""SketchName"", args)

[ android ]

+ Add full PAppletMethods implementation to Android, so that PGraphics
  and PImage methods are brought into PApplet.

+ Swap Run on Device and Run on Emulator
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1083

+ Fix XML crash on loading because of desktop-specific attribute
  error: ""http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd""
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1128
  This also fixes PShape on Android:

[ plumbing ]

+ Switch to using java.awt.Desktop classes for opening folders, links, etc.

+ Include createTextArea() in Editor for the GSOC projects.

+ Add code for setting the L&F from the prefs file for Linux.

+ Added 'all tabs' checkbox to Find & Replace, but not implemented yet.
  This would be a great project for someone to finish:

  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1162

+ Remove bad cast in PGL during error reporting.

+ Make Mode menu into a radio button, so it cannot be de-selected
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1227

[ changes and additions ]

The Mac OS X version should work again in spite of Apple's best efforts!

[ additions & removals ]

+ Command line support is now available for Java mode. On Windows and Linux,
  use the processing-java program. On Mac OS X, there's an option in the
  Tools menu to install the command line tool.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=142

  Build and export options should even work in headless mode when enabled
  (no guarantees, but simple test results were promising).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=220

  Android and JavaScript mode are not supported, contributions are welcome:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1323

+ Added a Tool for Mac OS X to help set up serial port. Using serial on
  OS X requires some incantations on the command line, and this prompts for
  an administrator password and takes care of them for you. The commands
  involve creating a folder and setting a few permissions. If everything
  is already set properly, the Tool will not be present in the Tools menu.

+ With the arrival of command line support, the misunderstood and sometimes
  maligned ""Use External Editor"" option has been removed.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=515

+ Fix several problems introduced by Apple's recent Java ""update"".
  Apple's most recent Java update may render older versions of Processing
  completely unusable, it's not quite clear yet.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix the exceptionally slow startup (a 5 second delay) in recent releases.

+ Find & Replace over multiple tabs (thanks to Manindra Moharana for the patch!)

+ mouseButton wasn't getting set on mouseReleased()
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1294

[ technical updates ]

+ JOGL has been updated, which may help iron out some GL quirks.

+ Change all build.xml files to use Java 6 as both source and target
  (avoids Java 7 warnings during build).

+ Updated ecj.jar to use jdt-core.jar... This is a larger file but were
  hoping that this would get our GSoC project ""XQMode"" working without
  the need for patches. Sadly that's not the case, but stay tuned.

[ known issues ]

+ Fewer exclamation points will be used to introduce future releases.

PROCESSING 2.0b6 (REV 0214) - 2 November 2012,2.0b6,214,2012-11-02 00:00:00-04:00,"Patching up command line issues that went backwards in the last release,
a number of OpenGL fixes, and more internal changes and updates.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Command line support was broken in 2.0b5, with an error about
  processing-java ClassNotFoundException: BatchCompiler
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1334
  On Mac OS X, you may need to re-run the ""Install Command Line"" tool.

+ Make sure the sketchbook is being picked up on the command line,
  so that imported libraries are handled correctly.

+ Import statements were executed within multiline comments.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=911

+ Editor not responding properly if the ""External Editor"" preference
  had been enabled with a previous release.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1355

+ A number of OpenGL fixes to better handle older chipsets, like the
  GMA 950 (found on lots of older Mac Minis and similar hardware).

+ Reverted back to an older version of the JOGL library to prevent
  issues with sketches locking up. In particular, this should fix
  sketches that use the video library:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1338
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1364

+ Icon loading was causing an error if you used a package for your code.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1346

+ No longer using --request on OS X 10.6, since it's not available.
  Avoids a harmless warning message on the console when running a sketch.

[ changes/additions ]

+ Added an option to Preferences to enable/disable advanced input method
  support to handle complex scripts like Japanese, Korean, or Chinese.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=526

+ Add option for blinking and/or block caret in the editor. To disable
  caret blinking in the text editor, add this line to preferences.txt:
  editor.caret.blink = true
  Or to just a block caret, use this:
  editor.caret.block = false
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1136

[ internal ]

+ Removed applet-related preferences, and the 'applet' subfolder in the
  source/distribution.

+ Removed the old 'cmd' folder from the source/distribution

+ Preferences are now written in sorted order to make it easier to handle
  comparisons or other debugging.

+ Major change to handle how the 'lib' folder is found, hopefully does a
  better job with command line support.

PROCESSING 2.0b7 (REV 0215) - 7 December 2012,2.0b7,215,2012-12-07 00:00:00-05:00,"475,382 bug fixes in this release as we work on finalizing 2.0.

[ changes ]

+ Removed all imports that aren't covered in the Processing reference.
  If you use java.awt, java.util, or other classes in your sketch, you
  will need to add an import line to the beginning of your sketch.

  Only the classes that are covered in the reference (HashMap, ArrayList,
  and some others) are now imported by default. This has been done to improve
  overall cross-platform parity and to avoid users unknowingly adding
  Java classes, and then the sadness that comes when switching to Android
  or JavaScript modes.

  The list of imports is now hard-coded (no longer read from preferences.txt)
  and includes the following:
  import java.util.HashMap;
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.io.BufferedReader;
  import java.io.PrintWriter;
  import java.io.InputStream;
  import java.io.OutputStream;
  import java.io.IOException;

  If we're missing anything that's covered in the reference, please let us
  know via the bugs database.

+ A new ""experimental"" mode has been added. It's the start of combining two
  of our Google Summer of Code projects (DebugMode and XQMode) to enable
  a debugger and on-the-fly error checking. We're including it in the release
  so that folks can test it out and let us know how it's doing. The interface
  still needs work and its innards may be a bit buggy, but it represents
  some exciting upcoming improvements for the PDE.

+ hint(ENABLE_ACCURATE_2D) has been renamed to hint(DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_STROKE)
  to better reflect what it actually does. Reference has been added.
  OpenGL drawing is significantly faster when the fill and stroke of a shape
  is drawn separately. This leads to visual artifacts on shapes where both
  fill and stroke is enabled (not a great idea in 3D anyway), so this option
  fixes the visual artifacts at the expense of speed.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1302

+ Sketch names can no longer begin with underscores (fixes an Android
  compatibility issue). This was changed in recent releases, but missing here.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=859

+ More Mac OS X key bindings have been implemented in the editor:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1354
  http://guides.macrumors.com/Keyboard_shortcuts&section=10#Text_Shortcuts

+ Set quality level higher when exporting JPEG images. This will result
  in larger JPEG files with save() and saveFrame(), but the default quality
  setting in the past was unacceptable for many/most projects.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=58
  See the bug report link for how to implement in case you want to set
  the quality lower (or even higher) than the new default.

+ Table row iterating syntax has changed. This code:
  for (TableRow row : table) { ... }
  has now changed to
  for (TableRow row : table.getRows()) { ... }
  (This may change to rows() on the next round, pending other API tweaks)

+ Change default for shift-backspace to just be backspace. To change it back,
  set editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete=true in preferences.txt.

+ Implement clip() and noClip() to set the clipping region.

+ Added blendMode() feature.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1385

+ Add different styles of arc drawing.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=711
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1406

+ Added XML.getLong() (also updated Android)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1378

+ Implement back-buffer sampler in OpenGL renderers.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1169

+ Change how get(x, y, w, h) was handled with offscreen areas.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=925

+ Make key and mouse events interleave, also improve threading.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=79

+ Changed event constants to PRESS, RELEASE, CLICK, DRAG, MOVE, ENTER, EXIT
  instead of past-tense versions of the same.

+ Removed mask(int[]) from PImage.

+ Implement postEvent() to put new events on the queue.

+ Add mouseEntered/Exited on the desktop.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=500

+ Change output from processing-java to be UTF-8 encoded.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1418

+ Disable Quartz renderer to fix line blending problem on OS X.
  This older renderer was faster but had some bugs, like one that
  caused lines to composite incorrectly when alpha was used.
  Add ""PApplet.useQuartz = true;"" into your PApplet.main()
  function to switch back to the old method:
  http://processing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/processing/build/javadoc/core/processing/core/PApplet.html#useQuartz

+ Remove requirement for Google APIs in Android mode.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=613


[ bug fixes ]

+ mouseButton not being set properly in mouseClicked.

  In addition, on Windows, error reporting wasn't working properly
  (couldn't find the right line or report the error correctly).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1440

+ Fix ugly results from resize() command on PImage:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=332
  and similar on Android:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=239

+ P2D/P3D PGraphics buffer failing to draw if larger than main surface.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1255

  textMode(256) is not supported by this renderer.

+ image(pgraphics, x, y, w, h) was only drawing once when shrinking.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1382

[ android ]

+ Like the desktop release, removed default imports. This includes:
  android.view.MotionEvent, android.view.KeyEvent,android.graphics.Bitmap
  due to conflicts w/ the new event system, and hoping to enforce better
  cross-platform compatibility between Java, JavaScript, and Android modes.

+ Changed event handling to hopefully clean up some inconsistencies.
  Removed motionX/Y/Pressure... these need to be handled separately.
  More here: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android

PROCESSING 2.0b9 (REV 0217) - 18 May 2013,2.0b9,217,2013-05-18 00:00:00-04:00,"The 2.0 interface has arrived! Mmm... pretty.

We've removed Android and JavaScript modes from the default download. You
can easily install them by selected ""Add Mode"" from the Mode menu. They've
been removed because the changes have not kept pace with the rest of
Processing, and it was holding up the release of 2.0. As separate projects,
we hope it'll be easier for volunteers to get involved, rather than our
tiny, worn out development team. View the projects here:
https://github.com/fjenett/javascript-mode-processing
https://github.com/processing/processing-android

There are also lots of goodies in the new data classes found in the
processing.data package that will make it much easier to handle data from
inside Processing. More documentation coming soon!

We're hoping this is the last beta before 2.0, but we're still haggling
with one or two issues that could require a beta 10. That's a lot of beta.

[ fixes ]

+ Major OutOfMemoryError problem with images fixed by Andres!
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1353
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1391

+ Lots of fixes for the library/mode/tool manager.
  Repairing colors, layout, etc. along with lots of internal fixes.

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1669

+ processing-java dialog window was huge
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1748

+ Library with bad version number in version causes stack trace to print.
  Added warning message about it with a pointer to the remedy.

+ ""New version available"" mesage is showing HTML tags around it
   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1684

+ ""Update"" not working in the manager
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1701

+ tint() with JAVA2D does not automatically refresh (with possible fix)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1730

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1661

+ Fix JSON and get it working properly. Now official API.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1660
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1680

+ Plus dozens of other P2D/P3D fixes that Andres snuck in there.

+ Last lines of a beginShape(LINES) are invisible in the P2D renderer

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1760

+ Rendering unlit geometry with TEXLIGHT shader throws misleading error message
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1757

[ changes ]

+ New images for modes. New design!

+ Added loadJSONArray(), loadJSONObject.

+ Hundreds of changes to the new data classes, sorting out their API, etc.

+ Fix autoformat to indent like the p5 book/examples. Thanks pif!
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=325
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/364

+ Removed netscape.javascript stuff that was only relevant for applets

+ Change error message for libraries (especially serial) for 32- vs 64-bit
  to clarify that the 32- or 64-bit version of Processing can be used instead.

+ Rebuilt the internal Runner to use SocketAttach... This may bring up
  a firewall message on some machines. Don't worry, it's safe (as long as
  the message is showing up when you hit Run, that's expected).

+ Add set(x, y) to PVector.

+ Removed div() and mult() from PVector, since not a legit math operation.
  https://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1506
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1544

+ loadImage() with TGA causing images to be upside-down
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1682

+ Added getIntContent(), getFloatContent() to XML

+ Table switch to CATEGORY instead of CATEGORICAL (not documented)

+ removed createXML() and createTable()... just use 'new' for these

+ Add official API for mouse wheel support
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1461
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1423

+ Incorporated JDI changes from Manindra. This makes the download a little
  larger, but is a step toward being able to have a simpler download that
  only requires a JRE (and is therefore much smaller!)

[ changes ]

+ A handful of tweaks to smooth out the 2.0 user interface.
  Incorporates some of the feedback suggested here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/1822
  while trying to preserve the look & feel of our PDE design.

+ Added built-in fonts (Source Sans and Source Code from Adobe)
  as the default font for the UI and editor. As usual, the editor
  font can be changed in preferences.txt. And if you already have
  a preferences.txt file, the new font won't override it. Fonts
  for GUI elements can be modified in lib/theme.txt, but be careful
  with those, and don't complain if/when they break.

+ Added several additional functions for data classes. More details
  in the reference and coming soon.

+ Changed how null values were handled with binary tables. If anyone
  was using the (undocument) .bin format for Table, you'll need to
  re-save your data.

+ Changed XML.toString() (what's called when you print() or println()
  an XML object) to just send a single line of text instead of a full
  XML document with a header. Use format(numSpaces) if you want a
  properly formatted document with declaration at the top.

[ data, data, data ]

+ Error in IntList and FloatList insert()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1929

+ Add a sort() method to Table.

+ Implement version of Table that takes a dictionary file. Syntax is:
  Table t = loadTable(""bigdata.tsv"", ""dictionary=bigdata-dict.tsv"")
  This allows you to set the data type of columns before loading, which
  provides much better performance and lower memory usage.

+ Constructing table from an Iterator is missing
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1956

+ Add sum() to IntList and FloatList
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1893

+ When using increment() on IntList, make sure the index exists and
  automatically resize the list if necessary. This is more in keeping
  with increment() in the Dict classes.

+ getSubset() broken in IntList, StringList, and missing from FloatList
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1979

[ internal changes you'll never notice... unless I broke something ]

+ Add an exception wrapper for startup, hopefully we can catch/debug
  more ""Processing can't start!"" issues with this.

+ Update JNA from 3.2.4 to 3.5.2.

+ Updated JOGL to 2.0.2.

+ Added methods to move files to Trash/Recycle Bin where available.

+ Implement basic proxy server support for update checking and the
  contribution managers.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1476

+ Basic getShape(ch) implementation for font glyph shapes. Not finished
  and (therefore) not yet documented.

+ Change QUAD_BEZIER_VERTEX to QUADRATIC_VERTEX to match the API call
  (because this lives inside PConstants).

+ Add retina switch for PApplet to set useActive with OS X and 7u40.
  Prevents speed/performance issues with old sketches on retina macs.

+ Add error message for raspberry pi (and others?) about int buffers
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2010


[ changes ]

+ Experimental Mode has been removed from the default download,
  so that it can be updated more frequently. Install it and help us
  test what will become the 3.0 release of Processing!

+ Add ""Processing Foundation"" to the Help menu.

+ Java 7 is now used across all platforms. On Mac OS X,
  we're now embedding Java 7u45. More info here:
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms#Java_Versions

+ Major changes have been made to Export to Application.
  Read here: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Export_Info_and_Tips

+ print() and println() now make debugging fun! They can now take any
  number of parameters, which means that code like:
  println(x, y, mouseX, mouseY);
  will print out
  3 5 142 220
  No more println(x + "" "" +  y + "" "" + mouseX + "" "" + mouseY);
  that was for suckers!

+ A new serial library has been added! The results of Gottfried Haider's
  Google Summer of Code project now replaces the old serial library.

And everyone should wish Casey Reas happy birthday today!
This release is my birthday present for him. What did you get him?

Here's a more detailed rundown of what else is in this release:


[ new features and additions ]

+ For people using Eclipse, the new print() and println() methods add
  some quirks because of how println() works for arrays in previous
  versions of Processing. When printing an array, you should instead use
  the new printArray() function, which works the same as the old println().
  This will help avoid the compiler warnings with Eclipse and others.
  In the PDE, this should be transparent, because warnings are not shown.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2056

+ Update the JavaDoc, remove java.* package prefix ugliness. Also link
  out to the online version of the Oracle documentation.

+ Major work on the source and the build scripts as we completed the
  transition to Java 7, and away from Apple's deprecated Java 6.
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms#Mac_OS_X

+ Incorporated a version of Oracle's appbundler for OS X build. Made heavy
  modifications to the original version to add features and simplify.

+ Culled un-needed resources from the Java 7 runtime to save space.
  Unfortunately Java 7 is also much larger than Java 6, so the size change
  isn't as considerable as we would hope.

+ Remove unused/outdated 'Mangler' Tool example

+ Remove video library for other platforms in download. This saves
  significant space because we're not doing cross-platform export anymore.

+ Update apple.jar file with new version
  https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions/Introduction/Intro.html

+ Update build instructions on Github
  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1629

+ Many changes to the Supported Platforms page
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms

+ Updates to the Export page to cover changes in this release

PROCESSING 2.1 (REV 0223) - 27 October 2013,2.1,223,2013-10-27 00:00:00-04:00,"There have been major changes since 2.0.3, most of them are outlined in
the release notes for 2.1 beta 1 (look down a few dozen lines).

This release includes a few updates to fix problems introduced in the beta
release, as well as additional general bug fixes, especially for OpenGL.

+ Added an option to not embed the Java runtime into an exported application.
  This saves you the 100 MB footprint, but requires your users to install
  Java 7u45 or later. Details on the same page that nobody read last time:
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Export_Info_and_Tips

+ The new println() (see the beta 1 notes) makes some old code behave a
  little differently. In the past, println() with an array would write
  out the array, one element per line, with the index in the front. i.e.:
  PFont.list()) would write something like this to the console:

  [0] ""Serif""
  [1] ""SansSerif""
  [2] ""Monospaced""
  [3] ""Dialog""
  [4] ""DialogInput""
  [5] ""ACaslonPro-Bold""
  [6] ""ACaslonPro-BoldItalic""
  ...and so on

  Now it's going to write out something like:

  Serif SansSerif Monospaced Dialog DialogInput ACaslonPro-Bold...

  To get the old behavior, use printArray(). It's the price of progress,
  and shouldn't really ""break"" anyone's code since it's just writing to the
  console. We think the new syntax outweighs the downside of the change.

  With arrays of primitive types (int[], float[], anything that's not an
  object), we've added code so that println() works as before. But we
  can't do the same for arrays of objects, such as String.

+ The preference for font smoothing (anti-aliasing) in the editor has been
  reset in this release. Fonts are unusably gross on OS X (and Linux)
  without smoothing and Oracle's version of Java (now in use with 2.1),
  and many longtime users have anti-aliasing turned off. You can still
  turn off smoothing in the Preferences window, but the results may be poor.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2164
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2160


[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix dataPath() problem with OS X (was breaking Movie on export)

+ Command line processing-java was broken in 2.1 beta 1 on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2159

+ Fix a situation where processing-java would return 0 instead of 1 on errors
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1798#issuecomment-26711847

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2030

+ Additional UI font tweaks due to decreased legibility with Oracle Java
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2135

PROCESSING 3.0a2 (REV 0229) - 31 July 2014,3.0a2,229,2014-07-31 00:00:00-04:00,"The 3.0 train gains steam and continues to hurtle down the track.


[ changes ]

+ Added a new sketchbook location, so that you can have separate sketchbooks
  with 2.0 and 3.0 releases. The downside is that they won't stay in sync,
  but the upside is that sketches that haven't been updated, or conflicting
  Libraries, Modes, or Tools won't cause trouble with the other version.
  The new preference is called sketchbook.location.three (the old preference
  was sketchbook.location). If you already have a 2.0 sketchbook, that will
  be used by default with 3.0 until you change it in the Preferences window.

+ Neglected to mention with the previous release that the video library has
  been removed from the default download. This decreases the size of the
  Processing download by about 20%. In addition, it was only the video
  library for the platform being downloaded, and with the return of cross-
  platform application export, that could cause sadness. To use the video
  library, use the ""Add Library..."" menu and select it from the list.

+ Added a new preference for the 3.0 sketchbook location, so that a separate
  sketchbook (and with it, different Modes, Tools, and Libraries) can be
  used with Processing 3.0 versus older versions of 2.x.

+ Remove default menu bar hack for OS X
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8022667

+ Move to native OS X full screen (supported in 10.7 and later)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2641
  This allows us to remove native code for hiding the menu bar.
  But it may introduce more quirks, we'll have to test it out.


[ fixes ]

+ The Examples weren't included in 3.0a1. Oops.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2652

PROCESSING 3.0a6 (REV 0233) - 25 April 2015,3.0a6,233,2015-04-25 00:00:00-04:00,"This is the big one! We've jettisoned PApplet as the base class so that
we can improve performance, reduce flicker, and have a better base from
which to build better, more modern graphics rendering. More of the
gory details for the PApplet/PGraphics changes can be found here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/master/core

Speaking of breaking things, we're on the road to a new GUI as well:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3072
and that means all Modes and some Tools will need to be updated:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3080

We've also made major changes to better integrate PDE X, Tweak Mode,
and other nice features for the default ""Java"" Mode. These will be the
center of the changes for 3.x, which is focused on improving the editing
and debugging experience in general.

Suffice to say, this is truly an ALPHA quality release. We're pushing it
out so that we can get more people testing it. If you want something more
stable, we recommend 3.0a5 (not 2.2.1, that thing is old!)

Library/Mode/Tool authors: Please help us get 3.0 ready by getting your
code ready for 3.0! Because 2.x and 3.x contributions are separate, you
can maintain separate versions if you like (or only support 3.x). You
can also specify the earliest and latest revisions of Processing that
your code supports, so that it's only installed with the correct version.
If anything is unclear, please file an issue. I've not had time to write
up all the changes yet (and some are still in progress), but what you see
in this release is representative of where we're headed for 3.0.

[ sketch ]

+ Added E2D, an experimental/enhanced renderer that draws directly
  to the Graphics context without an intermediate image. This greatly
  speeds up performance (especially on retina/hidpi displays), but
  prevents pixel access (no save(), saveFrame(), loadPixels(), etc).

PROCESSING 3.0a8 (REV 0235) - 17 May 2015,3.0a8,235,2015-05-17 00:00:00-04:00,"Stabilizing the mess from 3.0a6 and 3.0a7. Read the release notes for
those versions (below) if you haven't already.

If you're using Eclipse or another IDE, be sure to read the ""changes""
section below, for a change in how the size() command works.


[ fixes ]

+ size() sometimes erratic (i.e default size used) This was often
  seen with large setup() functions, or on more esoteric platforms.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1672

+ Command line ""processing-java"" was broken

+ Sketchbook window requires restart of Processing before updating
  after sketchbook location change.

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3280

+ ""Buffers have not been created"" error for sketches w/o draw()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2469


[ changes ]

+ Behind the scenes, the size() method is now moved out of setup()
  and into a method named settings(). The settings() is called before
  setup() and is the only place where size() can be used. If using
  Processing without the PDE (i.e. with another IDE like Eclipse),
  remove the size() method from setup() and instead place it like so:

  public void settings() {
    size(400, 400, P3D);  // your size() command here
  }

  The rest of your code remains unchanged. The PDE does this
  transparently, so 99% of people won't even notice this change.
  However, it allows us to fix (and avoid) a lot of really nasty
  complications that come from how Processing lets you switch
  between 2D drawing and OpenGL and even something like PDF with
  simple changes to the size() method.

  We're trying ""settings()"" as the method name, but that may change
  in a future alpha release. Once we hit beta, it will not change.

  For those familiar with them, the sketchWidth(), sketchHeight(),
  sketchRenderer(), etc methods should no longer be used. This new
  implementation of the settings() method is a simpler solution.

+ Added SVG Export library (works like PDF Export). This has not
  been tested heavily yet.

+ Replace Tweak Mode ColorSelector with JComponent version
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3209

+ Fairly major rewrite of createShape(), shouldn't affect anything,
  but keep an eye out for regressions.

+ Add new String/Int/FloatDict constructors that take an array for
  useful static/<init> initialization

+ Move svgz handling to PApplet, remove objz handling

+ Implement blendMode in FX2D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3275

+ Added StringList(Object...) constructor to handle a grab bag of objects

+ Added appendUnique() to Int/Float/StringList to only add unique items
  to a list. Replaces the following code, making ""set"" operations easier:
  if (!theList.hasValue(value)) {
    thiList.append(value);
  }

+ Inside main(), don't set 'args' to a zero-length array if no args
  were passed in, instead leave 'args' null.

+ Debugger ""String is null"" error when hitting breakpoint
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3265

PROCESSING 3.0a11 (REV 0238) - 16 July 2015,3.0a11,238,2015-07-16 00:00:00-04:00,"Hopefully the last release before we go to beta.


[ new additions ]

+ You'll be greeted by a Welcome screen. We haven't finished the text for
  one of these yet, so you'll see some lorem ipsum (fake) text instead.
  We'll wrap that up before the beta release.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3358


[ breaking all of the things ]

+ For Tool and Mode authors, you'll need to make some (small) changes.
  These aren't structural, but will require a rebuild of your code.
  Our hope is that this will be the last round of changes for the 3.x
  series, and that it's now safe to update your Modes and Tools to be
  compatible with the final 3.x release. Changes in this release:

  - Several classes have been moved to a new processing.app.ui package.
    The processing.app package was much too unwieldy and made it difficult
    for people to hack on the PDE code.

  - Several functions have moved out of Base and into Util (or Toolkit).
    Most of these are file-related (removeDir() and others), but the
    Base class had simply grown to a ridiculous size. It remains enormous
    but is a little less ridiculous.

+ Removed the init() method from PApplet; it's no longer needed

PROCESSING 3.0b1 (REV 0239) - 6 August 2015,3.0b1,239,2015-08-06 00:00:00-04:00,"This is the big one! The first beta, which will now be the default download
on the site. That means we think this is the best release of Processing that's
currently available, and that nearly everyone should be using it. It doesn't
mean we've worked out all the bugs just yet, but hey, who has?

A still-in-progress rundown of the changes in Processing 3 is here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0

2.x Modes, Tools, and Libraries will need to be updated for 3.x, so if you're
an author of these, see the notes in the link above. We're also planning some
sort of online Q & A / office hours / talk to Ben about what's changed session
to help folks along. We want to help, we just need to find the time.

And for those into the nitty gritty, or who enjoy lame jokes about esoteric
technical details, the detailed changes since 3.0 alpha 11 are below.

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3545
  In the past we were auto-detecting if it was the screen size,
  and switching to full screen mode. But that's now removed because
  fullScreen() is so easy, and full screen may not be wanted.

PROCESSING 3.0b4 (REV 0242) - 17 August 2015,3.0b4,242,2015-08-17 00:00:00-04:00,"Fixes for several long-standing bugs, plus some internal changes
to make the code slightly more usable by contributors.

For Tool and Mode developers, several functions have moved out of
processing.app.Base and into the Messages and Platform classes.
For instance, Base.isWindows() has moved to Platform.isWindows()
(seems almost logical, right?) We're not keeping deprecated versions
of these functions around since we're breaking other things in 3.0.

Library/Mode/Tool authors, there's a section for you at the end of
this page: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0
If there's anything that's not covered properly, please file an issue:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/new

PROCESSING 3.0b6 (REV 0244) - 11 September 2015,3.0b6,244,2015-09-11 00:00:00-04:00,"And I beheld when he had released the sixth beta, and, lo, there was
a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,
and the moon became as blood.

Aside from bug fixes, the FX2D renderer has received a lot of attention.
On the plus side, it's working really well. On the minus side, we're giving
up on making it the default for 3.0. The underlying JavaFX technology it uses
is just not ready for our use. It is, however, super fast and makes great
looking 2D sketches on retina devices. But it can be a little balky so we
don't want it to be the first experience that beginners have with Processing.
Especially if you're doing 2D on a retina Mac, you should definitely try FX2D.
We're at the limit of what we can do performance-wise with the default
(JAVA2D) renderer, so if you're having performance problems, try FX2D.

the summer, maybe you should take the afternoon off and dive into
a new Processing release?


[ pde fixes ]

+ NullPointerException in LanguageBundle.read() on startup that prevented
  Processing from starting up on Windows machines. Network drive issue.

  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4582
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4476

  continue in the background because it's needed for parsing/preprocessing,
  but some were complaining about the error checker messages.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4491
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4485

+ Updates to Japanese translation
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4564

  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4559

+ Update to Java 8u102 build 14


[ api fixes ]

+ Rewrite CSV handling to take care of some parsing bugs and improve

  performance, but can cause weird glitches. Bring it back by using
  hint(ENABLE_ASYNC_SAVEFRAME) in your code to blissfully and speedily
  create image sequences.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4578

+ Prevent NPE in loadImage() when called before setup()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4505

  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4508

+ IO: We want motors, they said (implements SoftwareServo)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4546

+ Add a temporary workaround for the CHIP to deal with cursor problems
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4554

+ Fix GLExceptions on Raspberry Pi when using offscreen PGraphics
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4524


[ fixed earlier ]

+ Debugger deadlocks when choosing ""Step Into"" on println()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3923

+ Suggestions switch scope to first import
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4016

+ loadImage() immediately after saveFrame() foiled by async default
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4218
  the hint() mostly works, but gross to use a hint frequently

+ Fix the Downloader so that builds work again
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4496
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4511

[ fixes ]

+ Find in reference for size() opens StringList.size()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4224
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4655

+ Limit rollovers on EditorStatus to the text portion. Clicking the status
  area when a URL was showing was problematic because it's also the separator
  used to adjust the relative size of the two panels.

+ Switch to Java 8u111. Not using 8u112 because the build numbers are
  different depending on the platform, and no 112 fixes are known useful.

+ Errant ""Could not open the URL"" when clicking on error messages

PROCESSING 3.3 (REV 0257) - 12 February 2017,3.3,257,2017-02-12 00:00:00-05:00,"This release adds the ability to the scale the UI or high-resolution
(known as HiDPI) screens on Windows and Linux. Sketches don't scale yet,
but this will at least make the Editor and Contribution Manager usable
again on more recent Windows and Linux laptops.

Note: the scaling feature is only meant to patch up problems on HiDPI
devices, it does not provide an all-purpose means for scaling UI elements
independent of the OS.

This release also attempts to fix several other Windows bugs, detailed
below. The ""unconfirmed"" fixes section is a handful of issues that I've
never been able to reproduce, but that should now be fixed. Please
confirm at the links listed to let me know if it's working.

This is release 3.3 instead of 3.2.5 due to the huge change to the PDE
for scaling, as well as minor API modifications (see below).


[ big fixes ]

+ PDE was too small on high-res Windows and Linux machines. If you're
  having trouble with this, change the ""Interface scaling"" option in
  the Preferences window. On Windows, it will attempt to auto-detect.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2411
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4183


[ unconfirmed fixes ]

+ Visual artifacts on Windows 10 when using menus
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4700

+ Broken characters in the Welcome Page and the Contribution Manager
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4747

+ Add a dialog box to warn Windows users about NVIDIA driver problems
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4853

+ Blank window on startup where the ""Welcome"" screen should be
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3933


[ minor fixes ]

+ Prevent unnecessary 'file not found' errors in the console during Export


[ fixed earlier ]

+ Contribution Manager does not show all libraries until filter cleared
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4840


[ changes to core ]

+ StringDict(TableRow) constructor to create a dictionary from a table row

+ Allow lone double quotes in the midst of CSV strings. This improves
  compatibility with spreadsheets exported from Google Sheets.

+ Return null (rather than NullPointerException) for PApplet.trim(null)

+ Make trim() work on column titles as well

+ Make Table.trim() also remove unused rows and columns. This will remove
  extra rows or columns at the beginning as well, since that's what trim()
  does to whitespace on strings.

+ Consume Unicode BOM (0xFEFF) in createReader() and Table parser

+ Return null for getString(), getJSONObject(), and getJSONArray()
  when key is not present, more in line w/ other API

+ Several fixes for memory leaks from jdf

PROCESSING 3.4 (REV 0265) - 26 July 2018,3.4,265,2018-07-26 00:00:00-04:00,"Kind of a huge batch of bug fixes and updates.

We've had trouble on Windows when MS Security Essentials or Windows Defender
decides to defend your machine from our software, removing files from the
download and making Processing unusable. A few extra checks have been added
so that more helpful warnings can be conveyed when this happens.

The other important fix is better handling in the Contributions Manager
for sites that use https. This fixes Python Mode installation, and many
others that have recently started reporting ""Could not find a ... in the
downloaded file"" when installing a Library, Mode, Tool, or Example set.

We're also bumping the release to 3.4 because of a lot of additions,
plus some internal changes that have an impact on API.


[ the big ones ]

+ Show alternate error message on Windows when jnidispatch.dll or core.jar
  have been removed by Windows Defender or Microsoft Security Essentials.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5537
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4929
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5442
  This has been a huge headache for us. We've repeatedly submitted the
  software and asked Microsoft for help, but haven't had any luck.
  If you run into this issue and would like to help, please submit the files
  to Microsoft here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
  Perhaps if there are enough reports, they'll understand this is affecting
  a lot of people.

+ Contributed libraries/examples/etc that redirect to https URLs now working.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5554


[ new features ]

+ It's now possible to make your own theme file for Processing. Copy the
  theme.txt file from inside the Processing folder to your sketchbook
  folder, and then edit away. For instance, to make a dark theme:
  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Dark-Theme-for-PDE

+ It's now possible to copy the text of the status bar. Click the clipboard
  icon at the right-hand side to copy the text to the clipboard. To search
  immediately, use shift-click.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5271
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5345
  The default search engine is Google, but you can modify that by altering
  the 'search.format' line in preferences.txt

+ Added pyde as a supported extension, so double-clicking
  on Python sketches will launch the PDE.
  https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/284


[ do you like data? ]

+ Added Double and Long versions of the data classes. Not sure if we'll
  keep these, but we're trying them out.

+ Also add subset(long) and subset(double) to PApplet

+ Changed the internal Sort class to use int for comparisons for better
  accuracy, especially when working with double and long values.

+ Consistently implemented write(PrintWriter) in the List and Dict classes

+ Added save(File) to the List and Dict classes

+ Prevent Table.sort() from throwing NullPointerException with empty cells


[ updates ]

+ Fixed up the Welcome dialog. When closing the window or hitting ESC,
  the ""show this"" selection is recorded. Also clicking that text will
  toggle the checkbox on/off, as users would expect.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3911
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3912

+ Redesigned the Rename window to be less ugly. Now closes when ESC is
  pressed, and the default action is set so hitting Enter will work properly.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5391
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5400

+ Rewrite exec() to do threads, also handle fast/excessive output cases

+ Rewrite requestImage() to fix errors/slowness/concurrency problems

+ Refactoring inside the completion code
  https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/7e3661e9f7a6df1569c8bebc683e7742f50caa25

  https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/ff7dc4d5094ccf1cc35189c9412adda93153b436

+ Now using Java 8u181.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5586

+ Change lack of blendMode() to a warning rather than an error in PDF

+ Updated the copyright and year in the launch and About screen.

PROCESSING 3.5 (REV 0266) - 20 January 2019,3.5,266,2019-01-20 00:00:00-05:00,"Hello from the flight back from Processing Community Day 2019 in LA!
How about a new release? Lots of bug fixes and updates for you.

We're rolling the minor version from 3.4 to 3.5 because of the additions
to the API and a minor (breaking) change to remove() in the Dict classes.


[ api changes and additions ]

+ Added circle() and square() methods.

+ Added push() and pop() for parity with p5.js

+ Non-US keyboards have trouble with a couple of shortcuts,
  so their implementation has been moved to the language files.
  Please help us update the defaults for your language. More here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Localization#shortcuts-and-key-bindings
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2199
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3538

+ Make JSONObject.quote() (both versions) public

+ Change behavior of the remove() method in IntDict, FloatDict, etc.
  It now returns the value removed, for consistency with the other
  remove functions (and most usefulness). In some cases, was returning
  the index, which isn't as useful. If remove() is called on a value that
  does not exist, an runtime exception will be thrown because there's no
  sensible way to indicate that nothing was removed. This is also more
  consistent with removeIndex() throwing and exception when the specified
  index is not available.


[ contributed fixes ]

  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4168

+ Updated Russian translation, now can choose Russian in preferences

,4.0a1,1270,2020-01-19 02:46:19+00:00,"*Revision 1270 - 18 January 2019*

This is a massive update! With the help of [Sam Pottinger](https://gleap.org/), we're working to get Processing to run with Java 11. This will give us a more stable platform for the next few years. 

In the process, there are also significant updates which include updated Java syntax support and lots of other long-awaited features.

We've started a [Changes in 4.0](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Changes-in-4.0) document to keep track of all the details.

We recommend using a different sketchbook location for 4.0, to avoid confusion with things that might be incompatible with your 3.0 work.


### Sam Did a Lot of Work

* [This](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/1) massive pull request has the changes that got things kicked off. It closes several issues and pull requests, including [5750](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5750), [5753](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5753), [4415](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4415), and others. 
* ANTLR has been updated from version 2 to version 4. The grammar has been updated for Java 8 and a new pre-processor created. [3054](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3054) and [3055](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3055)
* Support for Travis CI has been added. [2747](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2747)
* The macOS integration layer has been updated for Java 11. [5747](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5747)

,4.0a2,1271,2020-09-16 01:22:27+00:00,"*Revision 1271 - 15 September 2020*

Several fixes for this round, plus working on the guts quite a bit to prepare for newer/faster/better rendering methods.

The minimum system version for macOS (for the PDE and exported applications) is now set to 10.13.6 (the last update of High Sierra). Apple will likely be dropping support for High Sierra in late 2020, so we may make Mojave (10.14) the minimum by the time Processing 4.x ships.


### Known Issues

* If you're using P2D or P3D on macOS, and have `surface.setResizable(true)` inside `setup()`, you'll need to (temporarily) move that into `draw()`. We had to do an ugly hack at release time due to issue [124](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/124). The ugly hack also involves the window flickering once when it first opens in this situation. We should have that fixed for the next release.


### Bug Fixes

* Break `buildMenu()` into `populateMenu()` method to delay Debugger init [73](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/73)
* Fix broken macOS build [83](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/83)
* Bump JDK to 11.0.8, then rolled back to JDK 11.0.6 again [121](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/121), [123](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/123)
* Make macOS notarization part of the build process [24](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/24)
* `NullPointerException` in `ContributionManager.updateFlagged()` on startup. Now checks for directory `modes` and `tools` directories and read/write access on startup [6034](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6034)
* PDF was broken on `getImage()` call [62](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/62), [commit](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/624e9074aeb1d9e2e6b2943e35ffd97a90b8b737)


### Changes for AWT

To make way for more advanced rendering options, the exorcism of AWT from the base classes inside core has begun. More about that here: <https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exorcising-AWT>

* Remove all usage of AWT from `PApplet` [55](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/55)
* Make edits to core so that AWT can be disabled and LWJGL can run [commit](https://github.com/codeanticode/processing-openjdk/commit/ac9abc18655daaa538ef16945687177334f3596e)
* Add `--disable-awt` option to `PApplet.main()`
* Fix for precision issues with PDF [5801](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5801#issuecomment-466632459)
* Implement `displayDensity(int)`, it's been returning the main display's value
* Show “displays have separate spaces” warning message when the param is unset
    * Show it in the console, which allows us to get rid of `JOptionPane`
    * Catalina seems to have it un-set, but the default is the same
* Move `selectInput/Output/Folder` to `ShimAWT` class
* remove the `java.awt.Frame` object from `PApplet`
* Move `loadImage()` into `ShimAWT`
* `desktopFile()` and `desktopPath()` methods are supported, unless we find they're trouble
* Move `ShimAWT.loadImage()` to the `PSurface` subclasses
* Move all `java.awt` and `javax.imageio` out of `PImage`
* Make the switch to `getModifiersEx()` instead of `getModifiers()` [4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/4)
* Fix `PImage.save()` breakage due to AWT changes above (saving to PNG was broken in anything but the default renderer) [80](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/80)


### Sam was at it again

* Migrate JSSC to sampottinger/jssc [71](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/71), [75](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/75)
* Rewrite size call for all renderers [90](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/90), [91](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/91)
* Switch to JFileChooser on Mac with VAqua [88](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/88)

,4.0a3,1272,2021-01-18 03:07:44+00:00,"*Revision 1272 - 17 January 2021*

Happy [Martin Luther King Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day)! (Or MLK Day Eve, if you're reading this on Sunday.)

Several bug fixes and updates in this release, the most significant being video capture on macOS should be working again, and several OpenGL fixes that come with an updated release of JOGL. (Thanks to Sven Göthel, who continues working on it after many years.)

*Update - 18 January 2021 - The app was broken on Windows because of the… splash screen. The download link has been updated with a new zip that fixes the issue, ~or if you've already downloaded alpha 3, you can download the attached `processing.exe` and replace just that file.~*

### Known Issues

* The ugly `surface.setResizable()` workaround in the previous release is now properly fixed. [124](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/124)
* Haven't had a chance to test much with macOS running on M1 machines. Chances are this should run in Rosetta mode, but I've not had time to find out.

### Fixes and Updates

* Video [was broken](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134) on macOS because of Apple's security changes.
* Audio was [also broken](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues/51) on macOS because of Apple security changes.
* Fix `NullPointerException` in `getSystemZoom()` on startup in alpha 2. [143](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/143)
* `loadJSONObject()` and `loadJSONArray()` now return `null` if the given file was not found (in line with other `loadXxxx()` APIs. [6081](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/6081)
* Update the splash screen to say 2021 before the pedants can hunt me down.
* Contribution translation updates (thank you!)
    * Updates and fixes for the Portugese translation [133](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/133), [134](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/134), [147](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/147)
    * Correct alphabetical order for the language list. [146](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/146)
* Remove zero width no-break space `U+FEFF` character with `trim()`.
* `PShapeOpenGL.setAttrib()` warning referenced `setNormal()` instead of `setAttrib()`. [141](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/141)
* Add `var` keyword to highlighting [114](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/114)
* Fix revision number in exported code [135](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/135)

### And More from Sam

* Fix preprocessor spaces in the `size()` command to follow our guidelines. [136](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/136), [138](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/138)
* Move `PdePreprocessIssueException` to the test package. [130](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/130), [139](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/139)
* Fix regression where  `smooth(4)` was showing the “smooth() can only be used inside settings()” error. [149](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/149), [152](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/152)

### Internal Additions

* You can now create a “source” `.jar` file by typing `ant source-jar` inside the `core` directory. [118](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/118)
* Update Batik from 1.8 to 1.13 inside SVG Export library. Fixes incompatibilities with Java 11.
* Automate macOS notarization in the build process (done in 4.0a2) [24](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/24)
* Show Tool incompatibilities with a message dialog, and clean up a little of the internal error handling.
* Prevent “illegal line” message when loading library with `0xFEFF` chars in a `.properties` file
* Fixes to `Platform` code
    * Get rid of `editor.laf.vaqua` preference (use the `editor.laf` preference instead)
    * Move macOS-specific code out of `DefaultPlatform` and into `MacPlatform`
* Clean up “Export to Application”
    * Turned off 32-bit and ARM exports (no longer supported)
    * Drop '64' from the folder name (everything 64-bit from now on)
    * Remove “big fat lie“ error spew on export
    * Too many `.dll` and `.jar` files were included
    * Updates and text changes to be a little clearer
    * Fixed links for Java 11
    * Set minimum version on Windows, fix JDK download

Happy birthday to my goddaughter Kelsey! Let's celebrate with another alpha release.

This should be a bit more stable than the last round. I've rolled back some of the more aggressive anti-AWT changes (bad for longevity, good for compatibility) so images in particular are now behaving better.

But enough of that, let's go to the phone lines:


### What bugs have been fixed; why should I care?

* Sketch window location is saved once again: re-running a sketch will open the window in the same location. This was broken for a while! [#158](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/158), [#5843](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5843), [#5781](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5781)

* When using multiple monitors, new Editor windows will open on the same display as the most recently opened Editor window. [#205](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/205), formerly [#1566](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1566)

* A major Undo fix, this may even be [the big one](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4775), but it's not confirmed. (Please help confirm!) [#175](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/175)


### Were you too hasty with exorcising AWT?

* `cursor(PImage)` broken everywhere because `PImage.getNative()` returns `null` [#180](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/180)

* `PImage.resize()` not working properly. [#200](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/200)

* `copy()` not working correctly. [#169](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/169)


### Did you find any particularly niggling, but small issues?

* Catch `NoClassDefError` in `Platform.deleteFile()` (still unclear of its cause) on Big Sur. [#159](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/159), [#6185](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6185)

* Fixed `Exception in thread ""Contribution Uninstaller"" NullPointerException` when removing an installed contribution. [#174](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/174)

* If the default display is selected in the Preferences window, store that, rather than its number. It was discovered that plugging in a second display could bump the “default” display to number 2, even while it was still selected. Yay!

* Sort out calling `unregisterMethod()` for `dispose` from `dispose()` makes for bad state situation. [#199](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/199)


### How about contributions from the community?

+ Don't sort user's charset array when calling `createFont()`. [#197](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/197), [#198](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/198)

* Some exciting things are on the way for the documentation and web site. [#191](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/191)

* Update Batik to 1.14. [#179](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/179), [#192](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/192), [#183](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/183)

* Tweak the circle for number of updates based on Akarshit's initial attempt. [#201](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/201), [#4097](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4097)

* Make `parseJSONObject()` and `parseJSONArray()` return `null` when parsing fails. [#165](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/165), [#166](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/166)


### Is there anything new?

+ Added `PVector.setHeading()` for parity with p5.js. [#193](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/193)

* The default font (what you get if `textFont()` isnot used) has been changed to Source Sans instead of Lucida Sans. I just couldn't take Lucida any longer.


### Were there any internal changes I probably won't notice?

* Updated to JDK 11.0.11+9

* Update from JNA 5.2.0 to 5.7.0

* Modernize the RegisteredMethods code to use collections classes w/ concurrency. [#199](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/199)

* Set closed issues to [automatically lock](https://github.com/dessant/lock-threads) after they've been closed for 30 days. (This has no effect on open issues, only closed ones.) Actually this one you may have noticed if you had a lot of notifications turned on.

* Slowly transitioning some of the older code to newer syntax (lambda functions, etc). This is not a priority for anyone else: it's being done slowly, and as a chance to do code review on some very old work.


* Fix `textMode(SHAPE) is not supported by this renderer` message with SVG Export. [#202](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/202), [#6169](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6169)

,4.0a5,1274,2021-06-24 19:32:05+00:00,"*Revision 1274 – 24 June 2021*

Sneaking a release out the door ~~the morning before~~ while on a break from our company meeting. Don't tell my boss, he's kind of a jerk.


### Known Bugs

* Code completion is currently broken. Any updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/177).

* Plenty of other issues being tracked in the [Processing 4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues) and [Processing 3](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues) repositories. Please help!


### Updates and Additions

* Added a [few more](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/7b75acf2799f61c9c22233f38ee73c07635cea14) “entitlements” to the macOS release that may help with using the Video and Sound libraries, especially on Big Sur.

* Moved from the 11.0.2 LTS version of JavaFX to the in-progress version 16. This fixes a [garbled text](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8234916) issue that was breaking Tools that used JavaFX.

* JavaFX has been moved out of core and into a separate library. After Java 8, it's no longer part of the JDK, so it requires additional files that were formerly included by default. The Processing version of that library comes in at 180 MB, which seems excessive to include with every project, regardless of whether it's used. (And that's not including the full Webkit implementation, which adds \~80 MB per platform.)

* JavaFX is back and working again! This also fixes some Tools that relied on it, and Export to Application should be working as well. [#110](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/110), [#112](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/112), [#3288](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3288), [#209](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/209), [#210](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/210)


### Other Fixes and Changes

* Major font cleanup inside Preferences. It appears that the “Monospace” font may be [missing or broken](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/11-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8191522) with OpenJDK 11. Does it show a random sans serif for you? Let us know if it does. But aside from that, the Editor and Console font should be behaving a little more reliably.

* The Windows splash screen should no longer be tiny. Still sorting out some hidpi issues on Windows, but this one might make things a bit less quirky. [#4896](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4896), [#145](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/145)

* Better handling of `NoClassDefError: processing/core/PApplet` on startup with Windows 10. [#154](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/154)

* No longer using `JFileChooser` on macOS; it's too awful. This means a Copy/Paste issue comes back, but the cure was worse than the disease. [#1035](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1035), [#77](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/77)


### Internal Changes

* The minimum system version for macOS (for the PDE and exported applications) is now set to 10.14.6 (the last update of Mojave). 10.13 (High Sierra) is no longer supported by Apple as of September or December 2020 (depending on what you read), and for our sanity, we're dropping it as well.

* Updated JNA from 5.7.0 to 5.8.0.

* Remove the ant binary from the repo, updated the version we're using from 1.8.2 to 1.10.10.

* Rebuilt the `appbundler` tool for macOS to handle some recent changes, and disabled some logging chatter as well.

* Update to launch4j 3.14, fixing Export to Application on Windows.",https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/45193243,https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/45193243/assets,"https://uploads.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/45193243/assets{?name,label}",https://github.com/benfry/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1274-4.0a5,45193243.0,MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ1MTkzMjQz,processing-1274-4.0a5,master,Processing

,4.0a6,1275,2021-07-10 21:58:26+00:00,"*Revision 1275 – 10 July 2021*

Code completion is back! 

Added a new Movie Maker that creates MP4s and Animated GIFs! 

And a new color scheme sure to bring out the cranks!


### New Features

* Movie Maker has been rewritten and much improved! It can now directly create high quality MPEG-4 videos and Animated GIFs. Due to Apple [removing support for most video codecs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202884) after macOS Mojave, we could no longer export QuickTime videos. The new Tool uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) behind the scenes. The Tool also supports [Apple ProRes 4444](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202410), which is very high quality, and incidentally, the format that Apple's “QTMovieModernizer” formerly used to re-encode “legacy” video formats. [#6110](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6110)


### Design and Themes

* We've started work on refreshing the design. This round has a new set of colors. If you like them, great! If not, please hold your complaints. The internet doesn't need more negativity! We know some people won't like it, and we're [still working on it](https://twitter.com/ben_fry/status/1409968426093735941). We think you'll be happy with the final version—we have some exciting updates that we aren't yet ready to share, and it will all make more sense as the system comes together. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)

* In the meantime, if you'd like to customize the colors, instructions are [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes).

* The ""4"" icon and the current ""About"" screen are only placeholders. I was tired of looking at the 3.x design, and also needed to be able to tell the versions apart from one another. It's also necessary to start the replacement process: figuring out what things need to be updated when we incorporate the real versions.

* All that said, major work underway for improvements to how the visual theme is handled. We hope to ship with a dark mode option as well. Stay tuned!

* The splash screen handler has been rewritten because the Windows version in launch4j was too brittle. The downside is that it's a fraction of a second slower to show up, but the upside is that hi-res Linux and Windows displays get a nice 2x version instead of the crunchy low-fi (not in a good way) version.

* Add `ui.font.family` and `ui.font.size` as preferences.

* Added support for `0x` numbers to support alpha colors in `theme.txt`.


### Bug Fixes

* Code completion is fixed. Thanks [Sam](https://github.com/sampottinger)! [#177](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/177), [#219](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/219)

* `mouseButton` was not set correctly on `mouseReleased()` with Java2D. [#181](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/181)

* A more useful message for the `NoClassDefError: processing/core/PApplet` startup error on Windows was in the alpha 5 source, but may not have made it into the actual release. [#154](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/154)

* Fix `Module javafx.base not found` on Linux. Thanks [letorbi](https://github.com/letorbi). [#214](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/214), [#215](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/215)

* After selecting a font other than Source Code Pro, font went to a default. [#216](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/216)

* `unregisterMethod()` was broken. [#223](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/223)

* Fixed ""No library found for org.w3c.dom"" message when using that (built-in) package.


### Changes

* When changing to an incompatible Mode, just open a new window instead of giving the user a potentially confusing error message about it. [#189](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/189)


### API Changes

None of these should break anything, but if they do, please let us know!

* `Editor.applyPreferences()` was `protected`, now it's `public`.

* Removed `Editor.repaintErrorBar()` and `Editor.showConsole()` because they didn't appear to be in use. Holler if this breaks anything.

* Renamed `TextAreaPainter.getCompositionTextpainter()` to `getCompositionTextPainter()`.


### Internal Changes

* Removed `java.class.path` when launching code from inside the PDE. This should prevent conflicts, and avoid introducing problems when using Export to Application.

* Removed compound key actions (which were undocumented and not in use). This clears up a lot of complexity in `DefaultInputHandler`.

* Remove `jdt.compiler.jar` from subprojects.

* Cleaned up lots of dead/unused parts of `javafx/build.xml`.

* Move `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` to the `.github` subfolder.

* Removed extra files from Tools folders for the download.

* Moved doclet to separate repo. Thanks DSI! [#218](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/218), [#222](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/222)

Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first Processing release (revision 0001) which was first posted to be shared as part of a workshop in Japan at Musashino Art University (https://dbn.media.mit.edu/workshops/musabi/). This is the 277th release.

The primary goal for Processing 4 is to keep everyone's code running, even as operating systems, hardware, and hairlines continue to change.

This beta release will become the default download on the site, which means that it is more stable, usable, and better than the 3.5.4 release from January 2020. It's hard to remember what things were like in January 2020. But if you must use pre-pandemic software, we'll be keeping the release online.


## Highlights for Processing 4

Here are some highlights for Processing 4, since this will be the first time a lot of people are taking 4.0 for a spin:

* There's a new Movie Maker that creates MP4s and Animated GIFs!

* You can bundle sketches as double-clickable `.pdez` files and Libraries/Modes/Tools as `.pdex` files for easy sharing and installation.

* We're using Java 11, which should be faster, more up to date, and a lot more compatible with newer machines.

* There have been many updates for the Video and Sound libraries as we chase Apple's ever-changing guidelines for what constitutes “safe” software.

* For users more experienced with Java, you can now use newer language features! Sam Pottinger rewired the preprocessor (and brought us Java 11 support as well).


## Changes since alpha 6

A lot has changed! Trying to get everything in under the wire as we work to finalize 4.0.


### Features and Updates

* We've started work on refreshing the design. This round has a new set of colors, icons, a splash screen, and more. If you like them, great! If not, please hold your complaints. The internet doesn't need more negativity! We still have a lot of work to do, and we think you'll be happy with the final result.

* It's now possible to bundle sketches into a single file to be loaded inside the PDE. This is done with `.pdez` files, which is a sketch folder saved as a `.zip` but with the extension changed to `.pdez`. This means you can post a sketch on the web as a `.pdez`, and someone with Processing can click the link and have it load directly in the PDE. [#73](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/73), [#3987](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3987)

* Similar to `.pdez` files, you can install Libraries, Modes, Tools, and Example sets (things that would normally be installed with the Contribution Manager) by renaming their `.zip` file to `.pdez`. Double-clicking a `.pdez` file will open it with Processing, and ask the user whether they'd like to install it.

* It's now possible to do code completion and refactoring even when `.java` tabs are included in a sketch. Thanks Sam! [#157](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/157), [#230](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/230)

* Moved the preferences to `~/.config/processing` on Linux instead of `~/.processing`. This means your settings will be reset, but for most, that will be more of a plus with 4.x. [#203]( https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/203)

* Initial update of the splash screen and icons. These still need some work: the icons are too muddy at smaller sizes, for instance.

* The Welcome screen has been reset, so folks will see it again. We haven't made a decision on the Welcome screen for the final 4.0, but plan for it to be more useful than what's there now.

* “Show Sketch Folder”, “Add File”, and “Export to Application” now require Untitled or Read-Only sketches to be saved first, which avoids a weird situation where the user is dealing with files in hidden temporary folders. [#2459](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2459)

* The reference for Java Mode is now served up from a web server that lives inside the PDE. This means that the download has just a single file for the reference, instead of thousands of tiny `.html` files. Far fewer things to copy makes the installation process much smoother.


### Bug Fixes

* Really chatty console messages for longtime users who had older (like 2.x) settings files still on their machine.

* IDE cursor position on Windows was going weird if display scaling used. [#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226)

* Only call `errorTable.updateTheme()` if the Mode is using an Error Table (Python was not).

* `PShape.scale()` not working with `PShape.resetMatrix()` when P2D renderer is used. [#217](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/217), [#225](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/225)


### Should Be Fixed

Several things that should no longer be a problem based on updates we've done in 4.x, but not necessarily verified 100%.

* Undo feature may have undesired results (Fixed in 4.0a4) [#4775](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4775)

* HiDPI support for GNOME desktop. [#6059](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6059)

* AppKit errors from P2D/P3D. [#5880](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5880)

* Export Application broken in Processing 3.5.4 when using P2D or P3D renderers. [#5983](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5983)

* Cannot run `rotateZ()` within the `PShape` class. [#5770](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5770)

* `Profile GL4bc is not available on X11GraphicsDevice` error fixed with new JOGL release. [#6160](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6160), [#6154](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6154).

* `Profile GL3bc is not available on X11GraphicsDevice` should also be fixed. [#5476](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5476)


### Internal Changes

Things you're unlikely to notice, but in case something seems off, it's better to make note of them in case you see a related problem pop up.

* Now using JDK 11.0.12+7.

* Cleaning up `suggestions.txt` handling and related code.

* Removed code for pulling fonts from `JAVA_HOME/lib/fonts`, because it no longer exists in Java 11.

* Update `EditorFooter.updateMode()` to `EditorFooter.updateTheme()` and add it to the code called by `Editor.updateTheme()`

* Removed the JRE Downloader, because it's no longer necessary. [#155](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/155)

* Changed `Messages.loge()` to `Messages.err()`.


### Known Issues

* Support for `.pdez` and `.pdex` is not yet complete on Linux. Please help! [#239](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/239)

* Have I mentioned that the design of the icons, theme, layout, etc aren't finished?

,4.0b2,1277,2021-10-05 03:11:37+00:00,"*Revision 1277 – 4 October 2021*

Had to put things down for a while after the big push to get beta 1 out the door. But now we're back with an update mostly focused on fixing a few things that were broken.


## Lots of fixes

* Export to Application no longer broken when using P2D or P3D on macOS. (Though if you're a macOS developer, we could [use some help](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/284)) [#249](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/249)

* Allow imports with `color` in the name. This gets everyone's favorite toxiclibs working again. Got a fix from Sam, fingers crossed that it doesn't introduce new quirks. [#240](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/240), [#246](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/246)

* Movie Maker no longer broken when there are spaces in the path to Processing. [#268](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/268)

* Debugger was not working when selecting Debug from the menu, now fixed. [#282](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/282)

* ""Massachusetts Institue of Technology"" typo in loading screen. Not actually a big fix, but lots of reports about this one. [#254](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/254)


## …but it's still a beta

Not everything is fixed yet. Here are a few of the more obvious:

* The colors, theme, buttons, interface, icons, etc are not yet complete. We have the necessary help, we just need more time. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)

* Windows: Editor cursor position is offset to the right when display scaling >100% [#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226)

* macOS: IDE cursor position is wrong if font size is changed in Preferences. This may be specific to multiple displays, when one is retina and the other is not. [#194](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/194)

* Export to Application not working with the current video library. The video library isn't handled by me, but we keep hearing about it. Updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/188).


## Contributions!

I love getting help from the community. Thank you!

* The welcome screen was persistent, even if you told it to go away. Oops. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48), [#253](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/253)

* Fix minor typos in the PWM code for the IO library. [#266](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/266)

* French translation: fixed typos and added missing items. [#258](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/258)

* Fixed for JSSC library layout and upstream updates. [#119](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/119), [#229](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/229)


## And more…

Things you may not actually notice.

* Added `-Dpython.console.encoding=UTF-8` for Python Mode at the [request of jdf](https://github.com/jdf/Processing.py-Bugs/issues/322).

* Removed translated URLs that are not actually translated. Some of the Help menu translations were pointed at ancient links. [#250](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/250)

* Switch to getModifiersEx() in `processing.app` code. [#67](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/67)

* Deal with getFontMetrics() deprecation warning in EditorToolbar.

,4.0b3,1278,2022-01-15 15:35:37+00:00,"*Revision 1278 – 15 January 2022*

New colors in the UI! We're still making changes to the design of the UI, but this release includes a new theme engine that makes it possible to select interface colors from a set of options, as well as more control over choosing your own schemes. Check out Tools → Theme Selector for the magic.

We've also moved to Java 17, fixed lots of bugs, added a new default color scheme, and implemented better support for multiple windows with OpenGL.

We even updated the loading screen to include 2022 in the copyright notice.


## Fixing the bugs that won't fix themselves

* Added an option to “Disable HiDPI Scaling” on Windows for users that were having trouble with the editor caret (cursor) showing up in the wrong position, or text in the interface (on the tabs in particular) looking oddly jagged. [#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226), [#231](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/231)

* The “Disable HiDPI Scaling” option is a temporary workaround, with ongoing development taking place at [#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342). There's also a console warning if Processing detects that your display may have issues, however it's nearly impossible to do this with certainty. As a result, we can't enable the option by default, because it would make things worse for users who don't need it. Fixing this issue requires spending a lot of time testing different Windows systems, resolutions, monitor setups, etc.

* Too much writing to the console (from both System.out and System.err) causing the software to lock up completely. [#338](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/338)

* Got rollovers working again for the Toolbar buttons. Somewhat comically, these seem to have broken at some point during the 3.x development process, and nobody noticed.

* Fix a problem where the default font would misbehave after `textSize()` was called. Turns out the problem was that the wrong font was being used in the first place. But also added a warning for users when unsupported characters are used with the default font. [#303](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/303), [#4956](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4956)

* `listFiles()` and `listPaths()` with an extension specified were not properly matching directories.

* Fix for `disableStyle()` with 2D shapes in `P3D`.

* Allow `GEOMETRY` (not just `PATH`) with `contains()` in PShape. The `contains()` method is still imperfect, but it's just as bad with polygon shapes as path shapes.

* The Open/Save dialog box was crashing on Linux. Can't reproduce with this release, which uses Adoptium OpenJDK 17, so fingers crossed that it's resolved. [#306](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/306)


## Known Issues, the thorns that remain in our side

* The included version of the documentation is for 3.0, not the newer 4.0.

* The display scaling issues on Windows need to be resolved without folks having to use Preferences. [#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342)

* …aaaand pretty much anything [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Please help!


## Major internal work to support UI themes

* As mentioned above, several new themes are available from the “Theme Selector” option in the Tools menu. Selecting a theme will create a `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook that sets the interface colors.

* If you make changes to the `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook, you can select Tools → Update Theme to see those changes reflected in the interface. If there's no `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook, it will create a `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook, which you can edit. After you've saved your changes, select “Update Theme” again to see the updates.

* Selecting a new theme will resave your `theme.txt` file under a new name (`theme.001`, `theme.002`, etc.)

* Now using custom scrollbar widgets in the Editor so that it can better match the rest of the interface.

* Auto-generating toolbar and tab icons from SVG files based on theme colors.

* Implement automatic update for changes to `theme.txt` in the sketchbook.

* More documentation about all of this soon, which will live [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes).


## Hark, a sound from the West, and it is Sam

* Error when calling `smooth()` on `PGraphics` [#272](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/272)

* Detect if calling special methods on `PApplet` or not (and restore unit tests) [#288](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/288)

* Move Mockito to a new version. [#287](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/287)


## Behold, a sound from the East, and it is Andrés

* Finalizing support for multiple windows with OpenGL. [#312](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/312), [#313](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/313)

* Implement buffer object streaming for `P2D` and `P3D` and finalize attribute API in `PShape`. [#314](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/314)

* Add support to `PATH` shapes in `P2D` renderer. [#6009](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6009), [#316](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/316)


## The community continues pitching in

* Update Ukrainian language strings. [#301](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/301)

* Splash screen has default OpenJDK icon. [#297](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/297), [#329](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/329)


## Maintaining this 20~~0~~-year-old house

* Use UTF-8 for `readString()` and `write()` in net client. Avoids platform-specific behavior; Java 18 also making UTF-8 the default. [#336](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/336)

* Cleaning up the Create Font dialog while tracking down [#278](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/278). Removed `Serif`, `SansSerif`, `Monospaced`, `Dialog`, `DialogInput` from Create Font. Also sorting the list of font names, and skipping fonts that start with `.` or `#` because they're supposed to be hidden from users.


## Internal build and development changes

* Update [appbundler](https://github.com/TheInfiniteKind/appbundler) with the latest from upstream.

* Replace JDK 11 and JavaFX 16 with JDK 17 and JavaFX 17. [#285](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/285)

* Move up from JavaFX 17.0.0.1 to 17.0.1.

* Get rid of version numbers in the name of the `batik.jar` file.

* `ffmpeg` not downloading correctly on M1 machines. [#319](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/319), [#5775](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5775), [#5714](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5714), [#6230](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6230)

,4.0b4,1279,2022-01-24 13:44:10+00:00,"*Revision 1279 – 24 January 2022*

Loooots of changes under the hood to better support more platforms. And by that, we mean Apple Silicon (now in alpha!) and Raspberry Pi devices (once again). And whatever else gets cooked up in the coming years.

For the Windows users, the scaling issues have finally been sorted out. Use 125% and 250% and whatever weird Windows scaling you want, and it will work. You can safely uncheck the “Disable HiDPI scaling” checkbox in Preferences.

Against my better judgement, I'm posting a release that's native for Apple Silicon. **OpenGL is currently broken. Sketches crash immediately.** You should only use it if you're a masochist. Or a masochist that likes *extremely fast* but very incomplete software, and won't file bug reports saying “OpenGL is broken.” But it's being posted for folks who do not need OpenGL, and/or want to help debug. [#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370)

We've also moved the FX2D (JavaFX) renderer to its own library, which is available from the Contributions Manager. In related news, the download size is now 230 MB instead of 493 MB.


## New features!

* New downloads for Apple Silicon (incomplete! [#128](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/128)), and Raspberry Pi (32- and 64-bit). Some things are still broken, so the releases will be on Github but not processing.org/download.

* The design continues coming together, with new icons for exported applications, document files (`.pde`, `.pdex`, and `.pdez`), plus the Foundation icon used in the Contributions Manager. This work is still in progress, at least until [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48) is closed.

* Re-implement settings.path to support portable versions. [#3948](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3948), [362](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/362), [#360](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/360), fixed with [1a49263a](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/1a49263a94a2d7af2b4686286406f7896d207cd9)


## We're all regressing, why can't your software?

* Double-clicking .pde files on macOS was broken in beta 3. [#347](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/347)

* PShape not allowing attibutes of type `int`. [#344](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/344), [#363](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/363)

* Using `P2D` with `createShape()` causing `GLException`. [#353](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/353), [#367](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/367)

* Fix error in internal utility function to invert scaling. [#366](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/366), [#217](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/217), [#367](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/367)


## Other fixes…

* Tons of work to get the Windows version of the application to scale properly. Even the opening splash screen is behaving better. [#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342)

* `displayDensity()` was returning 1 when run from the PDE on Windows. [#339](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/339)

* Fix ""Could not delete disable_hidpi"" message that was showing up on macOS and Linux after closing the Preferences window.

* Major work inside the Contributions Manager: links to projects, links in description text now working. Some fixes to speed things up. Removing hundreds of lines of vestigial code. Fix the font being used on the progress bar.

* Removed ""Illegal reflective access"" warning on Linux. [#207](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/207)


## Changes

* Native libraries for OpenGL are no longer packed inside `.jar` files. This fixes slowdowns on Windows caused by antivirus software kicking into high gear. It also gives us a path to get OpenGL working on Apple Silicon. Unfortunately, this also means you'll need to set `java.library.path` in an IDE outside the PDE. [#4783](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4783#issuecomment-269328168), [#4239](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4239), [JOGL](https://jogamp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1301), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51100411)

* JavaFX moved to its own library. It no longer works with Tools and Modes as a result, but it was just too hefty relative to its importance. Read about it in [#348](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/348)

* A massive amount of work for our supported platforms. Some of the gritty details are [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Supported-Platforms) but we have six of them. Export to Application has been rewritten. It's now possible to build Processing on all six of these platforms.

* Cross-platform support for native libraries has also changed significantly. The `export.txt` file is ignored completely (no libraries required it anyway), and the subfolders names for native libraries have changed. See the layout of `core/library` for an example. Again, this enables all these platforms from Apple Silicon to Raspberry Pi.


## Contributed tidbits

* Select the entire line when doing Edit → Copy on an empty selection. [#100](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/100)


## You probably won't notice, but it's noted here in case you do

* Set the minimum Java version for Windows launcher to 17.0.1.

* Bumped Ant from 1.10.10 to 1.10.12.

* Upgraded JNA from 5.8.0 to 5.10.0.

* Spent a bunch of time looking into RSyntaxArea. It's not gonna happen. [#355](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/355), [#3199](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3199), and [the details](https://github.com/processing/processing4/blob/master/app/src/processing/app/syntax/README.md).

,4.0b5,1280,2022-02-04 00:49:12+00:00,"*Revision 1280 – 3 February 2022*

Tomorrow morning is the first day of using Processing in class, so I thought I'd add some chaos to that by posting a release the night before. Having started the first day of class being locked out of the classroom, I'm just looking for ways to keep the students from getting too comfortable.

**The aarch64 (Apple Silicon) release is not yet complete. If you want to use P2D and P3D (OpenGL) on macOS, use the Intel (x86) build, which is the only one that will be linked from processing.org/download until this situation is resolved.** See [\#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370) for status updates.


## Things you might notice in this release

* We've hopefully finally, *finally*, _finally_ fixed the problems with the text caret position. [\#194](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/194), [\#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226), and [\#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342)

* Syntax coloring updates based on the themes, mostly for the darker varieties.

* Added “Refresh” and “Show Folder” buttons to the bottom of the sketchbook window. Also cleaned up some of the guts to make it faster and less… quirky.

* Several fixes for resizing windows: P2D and P3D sketches should flicker red less, and the `NullPointerException`s when resizing sketches with the default renderer should be resolved. [\#386](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/386), [\#162](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/162), [\#4129](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4129), and [\#186](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/186)

* When running a sketch, it shows the “Play” icon instead of the Processing icon for its windows (just like it does when running an exported application).


## Out with the old…

* The twenty year old (and sometimes buggy) TIFF reader/writer has been removed, so Java's internal ImageIO is now used for TIFF files. The code is slightly slower, but the saved files are more compatible, and `loadImage(""blah.tif"")` will also work on more files than in the past.

* Also, image file names passed to `save()` and `saveFrame()` must have an extension. We are no longer adding `.tif` to files with no extension, because that can lead to confusing results, and the behavior is inconsistent with the rest of the API.

* Rewrote the ten year old (since we're keeping track of these things) code that handles `fullScreen()` to get it working on Apple Silicon. [\#221](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/221) and [\#372](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/372)


## Sam fixing up the preprocessor

* Several bug fixes to the preprocessor. [\#384](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/384)

* Better error message when mixing ""active"" (with setup and draw) and ""static"" (no function definitions) code styles. [\#290](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/290)

* Fix problem with function `size(int, int)` in classes. [\#317](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/317)

* Add (provisional) support for multi-line string text blocks. [\#371](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/371)

* `fullScreen()` when specifying the display number was broken. [\#352](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/352) and [\#392](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/392)


## Feature improvements in progress

* Adding core functions to replace the `surface` methods:
    * `surface.setSize(w, h)` now available as `windowResize(w, h)`
    * `surface.setResizable()` is now `windowResizable()`
    * `surface.setLocation(x, y)` is now `windowMove(x, y)`
    * `surface.setTitle()` is now `windowTitle()`

    There are also new event handlers `windowResized()` and `windowMoved()` that are called when the sketch window is resized or moved. We may still tweak the naming and behavior of these a little (consider these an ""alpha"" feature), but it's progress. [\#53](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/53)

* Added necessary infrastructure to support language translations in Modes. [\#236](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/236), [\#237](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/237), [\#2833](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2833), [\#3154](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3154), and [\#3337](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3337)

* Plumbing is in place to set the DPI of PNG images and the compression level of JPEG images. Though we still need some API for it.


## Plumbing you probably won't notice

* Several changes to how image saving is handled. There were lots of ways this could go wrong, this gets rid of several of them. Hopefully no new regressions!

* Tweaked how URLs are opened for better compatibility on different operating systems.

* Debugging failed installation of `.pdez` files.",https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/58651039,https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/58651039/assets,"https://uploads.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/58651039/assets{?name,label}",https://github.com/benfry/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1280-4.0b5,58651039.0,RE_kwDODK2Uic4DfvGf,processing-1280-4.0b5,master,Processing

,4.0b6,1281,2022-02-13 18:31:06+00:00,"*Revision 1281 – 13 February 2022*

Continuing the unintentional tradition of Processing releases on [Super Bowl Sundays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Sunday), here's beta 6.


## Scaling and stretching on Windows

* Windows scaling at 125% was stretching sketches to make them look crusty. [#378](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/378)

* `pixelDensity()` not working in exported Windows applications. [#5414](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5414#issuecomment-841088518)

* Implement sketch scaling in `PApplet` so that they take UI sizing into account. [#4897](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4897), [#4894](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4894)

These changes also include some extra native code on Windows, which is described in detail [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/tree/master/build/windows/fenster).


## Hell freezes over

For those of you that use Git (or other version control) this release includes an experimental(!) feature that lets you separate the name of the sketch from the name of the main tab. This means that you can use ""Save As…"" and it won't rename the file for the main tab. *Or* you can rename a sketch folder and the sketch inside will still work properly.

Uncheck the “Keep sketch name and main tab in sync” option in Preferences, and you're on your way. This is a *major* change to some of the oldest code in the PDE. If it has bugs, it may eat code. **Use with caution and report any issues you see immediately!**

Again, please help test this feature and [file issues](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/new) if you run into trouble.


## Bug fixes

* Actually set the correct names for the `windowMove()` and `windowResize()` functions that were announced in beta 5. [#53](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/53)

* PDF export not working with Processing 4.0 beta 5. [#395](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/395)

* Lots of issues discovered when making the sketch naming change. For instance, it looks like it was sometimes necessary to twice select the Mode for Android sketches. Also sorts out issues with when `sketch.properties` was or was not written.

* Fix `NullPointerException` on first use of Export to Application.

* RGB image created with `createImage()` has alpha channel. [#388](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/388)

* `CODED` is inconsistent between the default renderer and P2D/P3D. [#376](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/376)

* Fix multi-line strings not terminating properly. [#398](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/398), [#400](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/400)

* Clean up text sizes in the warning dialog box shown when sketch files change outside the Editor.

* Clean up error text in the console that showed up when sketch files removed from a sketch while it was still open (after the user was asked about them).


## Minor changes

* Fix up “Display N does not exist, using the default display instead” message. If more than one display, shows list of available displays (size and index).

* Move ""Add Examples"" to bottom of the Examples window

* Change cmd-click in window title to point to sketch folder, not the main PDE.


## Things you're less likely to notice

* Updated to Java 17.0.2+8. We hope this may fix the `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: accessibilityHitTest` error. [#408](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/408)

* Removed anachronistic `Preferences.save()` that happened after opening a sketch.


## Until further notice

**The macOS-aarch64 (Apple Silicon) release is not yet complete. If you want to use P2D and P3D (OpenGL) on macOS, use the Intel (x86_64) build, which is the only one that will be linked from processing.org/download until this situation is resolved.** See

,4.0b7,1282,2022-03-04 01:04:36+00:00,"*Revision 1282 – 3 March 2022*

The main thing for this release is to prevent an issue where files might be deleted (!) due to the change in beta 6.

…it also rolls back a change that broke Python Mode. Sorry, snake people!

…but also: a new feature! A very cool new feature! See below.


## Regression Repair

* Bring back `getMainProgram()` for Python Mode. [#409](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/409)

* Fix an issue where opening a single .pde file in an unrelated folder (i.e. Downloads) would delete the entire folder when deleting the ""sketch"" without being 100% obvious what it was doing. [#424](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/424)

* Andrés tracked down the problem with `POINTS` and `PShape` that was introduced in 4.0 beta 3. [#345](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/345), [#432](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/432)


## I'm just here for the ratio

Added a new `windowRatio(width, height)` function that remaps screen and mouse coordinates to the specified aspect ratio. 

The general idea is that you set a ratio, and whether you're using `fullScreen()` or `setResizable(true)`, the sketch will scale its coordinates (and the coordinates of the mouse to fit that same ratio. 
  
For instance, use `windowRatio(1280, 720)` in your code, and then all your coordinates will be re-mapped to that range—but always keeping the aspect ratio. Probably easiest to see by running this sketch:

```processing
void setup() {
  windowResizable(true);
  windowRatio(1280, 720);
  
  cursor(CROSS);
  strokeWeight(10);
}

void draw() {
  background(240);
  fill(255);
  rect(0, 0, rwidth, rheight);
  
  fill(0);
  textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
  textSize(200);
  text(rmouseX + "", "" + rmouseY, rwidth/2, rheight/2);
}
```

When using `windowRatio()`, the new `rwidth` and `rheight` variables contain the width and height that were passed to `windowRatio()` and can be used in place of `width` and `height` elsewhere in your code. 

Similarly, `rmouseX` and `rmouseY` contain the mouse position, scaled by the current ratio.

If your window is taller (or wider) than the specified ratio, your sketch will be moved (using `translate()` to fit the space, and `rmouseX` and `rmouseY` might even have negative values if they're outside the box. (Again, try running the code above.) 

The exact amount of space that's extra can be found in the `ratioLeft` and `ratioTop` variables. And the current `scale()` being used for the ratio can be found in `ratioScale`. 

Mind you, it might be tempting to use windowRatio(16, 9), but keep in mind that means your horizontal coordinates will be numbers between 0 and (almost) 16, and vertical will be between 0 and 9. Not a great way to work! (And at some point, likely to introduce quirks as you learn about the shortcomings of floating point number accuracy.)


## Minor Mites

* Half a dozen other fixes/changes for opening sketches and how it identifies the Mode and the rest. If you notice anything weird, let us know asap.

* Rewrote our native code for going full screen on macOS, retiring jAppleMenuBar after a decade of service. Also gets things working on Apple Silicon.

* Prevent “You must first install tweak Mode to use this sketch” when using sketches that date back to 2.0. [#415](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/415)

* Swap more uses of `Util.deleteFile()` and move files to the Trash (or Recycle Bin) instead. This can make more mess, but it reduces the chances of something bad happening when Processing deletes a file.

* Change straight quotes to smart quotes in the `PDE.properties` file. This just means that more UI and error messages will have nicer quotes.


## Until further notice

**The macOS-aarch64 (Apple Silicon) release is not yet complete. If you want to use P2D and P3D (OpenGL) on macOS, use the Intel (x86_64) build, which is the only one that will be linked from processing.org/download until this situation is resolved.** See

,4.0b8,1283,2022-04-23 19:46:06+00:00,"*Revision 1283 – 23 April 2022*

Lots of fixes! OpenGL on M1! Exclamation points!


## the big ones

* OpenGL now working on Apple Silicon! Many thanks to user @jaegonlee who provided the last [few](https://github.com/jzy3d/jogl/pull/17/files) [tweaks](https://github.com/jzy3d/jogl/pull/16/files) to get a build working. [#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370).

* Lots of work on how Modes are handled in the Contributions Manager to make it less… quirky. This will be a huge upgrade if you're a user of Python Mode, p5jsMode, Android Mode, and others.


## a whole mess of useful fixes contributed by @TN8001

* Fix text caret position shifts when typing Japanese. [#447](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/447), [#462](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/462)

* Some keys couldn't be entered on the On-Screen Keyboard. [#403](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/403), [#461](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/461)

* Fix error in Tweak Mode when using underscores in numbers. [#442](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/442), [#459](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/459)

* Fix IDE auto-formatting confused by method references. [#279](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/279), [#436](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/436)


## semi-noticeable fixes and changes

* Set minimum size for the scroll bar thumb. [#473](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/473)

* Change to ""Modes..."" or ""Manage Modes..."" and same for Libraries, etc

* A few fixes for `fullScreen()`. [#474](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/474), [#471](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/471)


## minor bug fixes and changes

* Fix logic for opening the correct “main” tab in `handleOpen()`.

* Dropping folder into sketch window throws weird exception. [#441](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/441)

* Fix `  does not exist` message on Linux startup. (The startup script was passing a blank sketch file name to the software.)

* Support multiple files being opened from the command line on Linux.

* Only show `setWritable()` failure in recent.txt when it is a problem

* Fix `NullPointerException` when changing the theme. [#476](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/476)

* Suppress `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: accessibilityHitTest` error in the console. [#368](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/368)

* Internal change for preprocessor to support Android Mode. [#470](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/470), [#469](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/469)

* `filter()` calls with high pixel density in OpenGL were making a tiny texture. [#429](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/429), [#433](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/433)

* Renamed parameters controlling GL buffer settings. [#435](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/435)

* Finalizing buffer object streaming changes to `PShape` when used with OpenGL. [#196](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/196)


## lots of work on the contributions manager

* Fix frequent “Error during download and install of Python Mode for Processing” message. [#5918](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5918), [#445](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/445)

* Manager fails to complete install of PythonMode when no windows open. [#5309](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5309), [#446](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/446)

* Allow update of the current Mode. This was causing confusion because you'd otherwise have to arbitrarily switch to another Mode to run an update, even if you never otherwise used it.

* Laying the basic groundwork for theme updates.

* Removing the current Mode (with no windows open) was causing an exception.

* Fix `NullPointerException` when clicking Update All on the Updates tab. [#440](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/440)

* Switch to using https to get retrieve the contributions listing.

* Remove overbuilt, undocumented search features in Contributions Manager. No more regex, but accents and others work properly now.

* Lots of cleaning out old code in the contrib manager guts. Rewrote category tallying for contribs. This was also hiding an issue that caused contribs to be re-added several times. Removed the “restart” flag because it was never used. Cleaned up accessors and other internal muck for how `processing.app.contrib` classes interact with one another.",https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/65152434,https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/65152434/assets,"https://uploads.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/65152434/assets{?name,label}",https://github.com/benfry/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1283-4.0b8,65152434.0,RE_kwDODK2Uic4D4iWy,processing-1283-4.0b8,master,Processing

,4.0b9,1284,2022-08-05 02:05:15+00:00,"*Revision 1284 – 4 August 2022*

Getting very close to 4.0! Just a bit more now…


## design, design, design

Perhaps most noticeable, this release includes a ton of refinement on the design.

* Another set of 16 themes, these with gradients, have been added to the Theme Selector. Have fun!

* If you've changed the theme in a previous beta, it will be reset the first time you use beta 9, because of major updates to theme handling (many new parameters, others renamed and cleaned up). Relatedly, changing the theme no longer writes a `theme.txt` file to your sketchbook folder.

* Added options to the Theme Selector to write `theme.txt` to your sketchbook folder (so you can make manual edits), and also to reload the theme dynamically (after you've made changes).

* Lots of minor fixes to typography and layout of elements. Hopefully you'll agree that the changes add up to things feeling a lot better.

* We're now using [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/) to improve the look and feel of dialog boxes and other components that we've not customized ourselves.

* Nearly all PNG-based icons and interface elements have been replaced by SVGs that are automatically re-rendered to match the theme when it changes.

* The base font being used is now part of the language translation, because specific fonts are required for non-Roman languages, or languages that are not supported by the Source Sans 3 that we use everywhere else. This also helps us get the language-specific overrides for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Greek, and Arabic out of the code and into something that can be updated more easily.

* The Preferences window has had a major facelift. It was giving me great anxiety. It was so, so ugly. It is now less ugly.

* The Contributions Manager is now themed and cleaned up to match the rest of the interface.

* We're replacing the underscores in tab names with spaces. It looks a little nicer with the default sketch naming. If you'd like to keep underscores, open `preferences.txt` and set `sketch.name.replace_underscore = false`.

* Updated the scroll bars to match the theme. [#265](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/265)

* New icon buttons for the status bar instead of hacky emojis. The clipboard icon even changes to a search icon when holding down shift!

* Implement 2x versions of the icons for the debugger window/variable inspector. [#3921](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3921)

* Taken collectively, these are the visual design changes for 4.0. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)


## new features

* New sketch naming schemes! For those who didn't enjoy the sketch plus underscore plus six digit date, your time has come. Visit the Preferences window and behold the naming options available in the dropdown menu. You can now use the “Friendly” naming scheme that folks seem to love, as well as a pair of other less serious alternatives. [#6045](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6045), [#6048](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/6048), [#144](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/144)

* It's also possible to create your own naming schemes. Create a file named `naming.json` in your sketchbook folder that follows the same layout in the Processing download. Provide a name, a list of prefixes, and a list of suffixes just like that file. Save it and restart Processing, and your new option will be available in the dropdown.


## other big ones

* We should be fully set for Apple Silicon (i.e. M1 and M2) support. [#128](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/128)

* Code completion stopped working between beta 4 and beta 5. Now it's back. [#491](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/491)


## community contributions!

* Double-clicking a `.pde` file also opens an untitled/empty sketch. [#477](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/477), [#479](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/479), [#218](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218)

* Updates to the Spanish translation. [#480](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/480), [#481](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/481)

* Updates to the German translation. [#483](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/483)

* Add `flatlaf.jar` to `config.xml` on Windows. [#498](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/498)

* Fix parsing of java error messages containing "":"" [#492](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/492), [#493](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/493)

* Exported applications were giving `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: --full-screen` errors. [#488](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/488), [#502](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/502).

* Editor was treating {} brackets as code when they're inside a String, char or comment. [#444](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/444), [#504](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/504)

* Add extra Java arguments to enable anti-aliasing for KDE users. [#513](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/513), [reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#aaFonts)


## bug fixes

* Fix “Unable to load Java Runtime Environment” errors on Apple Silicon machines. [#526](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/526)

* Updated the Help menu entries to make sure they're going to the right locations for 4.x. As with the reference, links are no longer local (see [#524](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/524)).

* Help → Libraries Reference and Help → Tools Reference submenu items were broken. [#5839](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5839)


## data updates

* Added `random()` method to the `XxxxList` classes to return a random value from the list.

* Added `getXxxxList()` methods to `JSONObject`

* Added `toXxxxList()` methods to `JSONArray`

* Renamed `getXxxArray()` to `toXxxArray()` in `JSONArray` for consistency. The old versions are still available, but deprecated.

* Switch to `toArray()` instead of `array()` in the `XxxxList` classes. Did not deprecate old version because it was actually broken.

* Lots of cleanup (and some bug fixing) in the `XxxxList` classes.


## internal changes

* Bumped the Java version to 17.0.4+8.

* If you get a “core does not run on this architecture” when running from the source, you may need to run `ant clean-jogl` inside `core`.

* Also added a `clean-libs` target to `build.xml` files that need it. This will re-download libraries that we rely upon like JOGL, Batik, Ant, and others.

* Cleaned up several files in the download, the footprint should be a few dozen megabytes smaller.

* Updated to the latest version of JNA (5.12.1) for better Apple Silicon support.

* All the remaining ancient bug URLs (Bugzilla and Google Code) have been updated and removed from the source. The Google Code issues are re-linked to their Github equivalents, and the old Bugzilla pages have been [revived](https://download.processing.org/bugzilla/) since their disappearance last August.


## known issues

* We've had to remove the offline version of the reference that was accessible from the Help menu. We hope to bring it back some day. [#524](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/524)

* The mixed mode warning is temporarily missing. [#519](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/519)

* `color` in imports shows up as an error, but code still compiles and runs. [#521](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/521)

* Need to make it possible to use “module” jars so that other JavaFX classes can be imported.

,4.0,1285,2022-08-09 12:24:02+00:00,"**4.0.1 is available! A nasty bug was found just after the release. So once you're done reading the notes below, please proceed to download the latest instead: https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/**

*Revision 1285 – 9 August 2022*

On the 21st anniversary of the very first Processing release (revision 0001), we're posting the final 4.0, which is the 286th release of the software.

The primary goal for Processing 4 is to keep everyone's code running, even as operating systems, hardware, and hairlines continue to change.

There are really too many changes to list, but you can start by reading about them [at this link](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Changes-in-4.0).

Below is a list of the incremental changes in this release since beta 9 a few days ago:


## welcome, welcome!

* Added a new “Welcome” screen that links to a couple examples as well as the changes and updates page. 

* The splash screen has also been updated with a new image for 4.0.


## wait, what?

* Export to Application was almost completely broken on macOS, where all apps were reporting as “damaged” when transferred to another machine. It's now working again, and also prompts users to install the Xcode tools. See the [wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exporting-Applications#macos) for more information about how to work with Apple's code signing restrictions.

* There was a *lot* of out-of-date material on the wiki pages in the Processing 3 repository on Github. We now have new versions of the major pages in the Processing 4 repository. This includes pages on [Themes](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes), [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Supported-Platforms), [Exporting Applications](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exporting-Applications), [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Troubleshooting), and the [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/FAQ).

* There are many entries in `preferences.txt` that are important, but not important enough to make it into the Preferences window. Some of those are now documented [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Preferences).

* Processing sometimes creates a *lot* of temporary files (basically, each time you run a sketch), which didn't always get cleaned up by the operating system. With 4.0, those are all being written to a separate “processing” folder, so that they can be automatically removed after 7 days. [#529](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/529)


## the last of the bugs

* When using Export to Application, errors in the code would cause the software to just report “error during export.” Now it provides the usual error message (about the error itself).

* The dropdown menu in the Theme Selector wasn't updating properly when new themes were selected.

* The rollover and pressed color for the console scrollbar was always blue.

* Inside Movie Maker, `ffmpeg` wasn't available on all platforms, that's now fixed. We've also updated to version 5.0.1.


## you probably won't notice

* Examples have been updated, and are now being pulled from the [processing-examples](https://github.com/processing/processing-examples) repository. May have also had to remove the sin/cos lookup tables from the Rotating Arcs example so that we could comfortably put it on the Welcome screen.

* Compress `jdk/Contents/Home/legal` into a single zip. It was 300 files, or 60% of the 500 files in the entire JDK.

And what sort of anniversary would it be without a regression that breaks a major feature? Ahem. Here's 4.0.1…

* In the 4.0 release, switching to p5.js Mode caused an error message to pop up. Now fixed. [#530](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/530)

* One minor addition: in the Preferences window, clicking the “More preferences can be found…” text will open the [wiki page](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Preferences) with more details about all these wonderful options.

,4.0.2,1287,2022-11-25 01:50:13+00:00,"*Revision 1287 – 24 November 2022*

🦃 Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃

Fixing more regressions and other steps backward found since the 4.0 release. Enjoy!


## the big ones

* OpenGL apps now work with macOS Ventura, once again thanks to @jaegonlee. [#544](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/544)

* Library version number parsing wasn't ignoring comments properly, so libraries that followed the template closely were showing `The version number for “…” is not a number`. [#586](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/586), [#553](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/553)

* The Updates tab of the Contribution Manager was throwing error messages about `this.progressBar`. [#567](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/567)

* `fullScreen()` with `pixelDensity(2)` was broken with the default renderer. On startup, the sketch would report `Display -1 does not exist, returning 1 for displayDensity(-1)`. [#487](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/487)

* JSSC update for M1/M2 from @sampottinger [#525](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/525), [#577](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/577)


## the li'l and medium ones

* After creating 26 sketches, the “take a break” message still showed up after restarting Processing. [#582](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/582)

* With multiple users sharing a machine, Processing would not work properly for the second user due to a problem with the temporary directory. [#549](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/549)

* Added explanation for how to fix Processing when a user disallows access to the Documents folder on macOS. [#581](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/581)

* Fixed an infinite loop that could be caused by running out of options for a sketch naming scheme.

* When calling `random()` on a list (now `choice()`) with no elements, it would throw a weird `Exception`. Now it throws a more descriptive exception.


## need some help here

Contributions from the community!

* Loading SVG file was giving `Illegal base64 character 20 encoding error`. Fixed thanks to @jaegonlee and @vepo. [#592](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/592), [#599](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/599)

* Updated Catalan translation thanks to @trikaphundo. [#550](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/550), [#554](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/554)

* Updates to the Spanish translation, also from @trikaphundo! [#552](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/552), [#574](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/574)

* A couple fixes for the Ukranian language strings from @rzats. [#585](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/585)

* @LesleyWagner fixed the vertical placement of top elements in the Manager window. [#520](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/520), [#539](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/539)

* Preprocessor fix from @sampottinger for function/variable ""does not exist"" errors reported when defining a class without `setup()` or `draw()`. [#579](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/579), [#597](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/597)


## steps forward

* Added a `choice()` method to the `XxxxList` classes, which returns a random value from the list. Similarly `removeChoice()` removes a random element from the list and returns the value.

* Also added a `choice()` method that returns random integers. So `int value = choice(10)` is a shorthand way of saying `int value = (int) random(10)`

* Removed the `choice()` (formerly `random()`) method from the `XxxxList` classes that took a `PApplet` object for its random number seed/generator. Just feels like overkill at this point.


## internal changes

* Using more Java 17 syntax in the code. No plans to really scrub everything to change the syntax over, just a matter of cleaning things up as we go.

* Fixed a potential casting problem with `Platform` and `DefaultPlatform`. Should have been unreachable, but fixed anyway.

* Brought back `getCodeIndex()` for GUI Builder Tool… then removed it again. [#545](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/545), [#596](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/596)


## me talking on the wiki

* Added a [Translations](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Translations) page to the 4.x wiki, which is update to the [Localization](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Localization) page from the 3.x repository.

* Posted [an explanation](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Naming-Sketches) of how to create a `naming.json` file so you can set up your own sketch naming schemes.

,4.1,1288,2022-11-28 11:54:31+00:00,"*Revision 1288 – 28 November 2022*

Compared with the 4.0.2 release which was focused on stability, this 4.1 release is focused on ~~instability~~ adding a couple new features. They'll need more testing, but hopefully you'll find them useful.


## what makes this 4.1 instead of 4.0.3

* This release adds initial support for [Language Server Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol), which means we will soon be able to integrate the compile/run process with other editors like Visual Studio Code. There is still a lot of work to be done here (this code is probably more “alpha” quality) but it's a good step forward. To use it, we'll first need an LSP “client,” which can be a community contribution so keep an eye out for that in the coming weeks and months. Thanks to @kgtkr for the LSP code here, it's a huge help. [#117](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/117)

* Support has been added for extended language tags, which makes available a Traditional Chinese (`zh_TW`) translation in addition to the previously available Simplified Chinese translation (originally `zh`, now renamed to `zh_CN`). You can see the full list of supported language tags [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-suported-locales.html#modules). We will keep the existing two-digit tags in place for now, and update them as needed when new language translations are added. Read more on the [Translations](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Translations) page on the Wiki. Thanks to @jsyeh for the `zh_TW` translation. [#600](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/600)

* Since the redesign of Processing.org, the offline reference is too large to include the download. In this release, a “Download Offline Reference” item was added to the Help Menu, for people who need an offline copy. It creates a file called `reference.zip` in the sketchbook. If that file is present, then the Help menu links and Find in Reference will use that copy of the reference. If it is not present, online URLs will be used. You can also manually copy the `reference.zip` file from sketchbook to sketchbook. Put `reference.zip` in the root of your sketchbook and restart Processing so that it picks up the new file. For instance, in a class situation, you might put the file on a shared server and tell people where to find it. Read more on the [Offline Reference](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Offline-Reference) page on the Wiki. [#524](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/524), [#213](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/issues/213)


## contributed fixes

* `size(863,863/2)` inside `setup()` function (fix from @sampottinger) [#602](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/602), [#609](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/609)

* Pre-processor was inserting extra spaces (another from @sampottinger) [#607](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/607), [#609](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/609)

* Fix the JavaDoc for mousePressed variable from @SableRaf. [#605](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/605)


## other updates

* In some cases, the Theme was not being saved after Processing was restarted. [#565](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/565)

* A few updates and clarifications in the `size()` reference.

* The Java version has been bumped from 17.0.4 to 17.0.5.",https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/84320786,https://api.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/84320786/assets,"https://uploads.github.com/repos/benfry/processing4/releases/84320786/assets{?name,label}",https://github.com/benfry/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1288-4.1,84320786.0,RE_kwDODK2Uic4FBqIS,processing-1288-4.1,main,Processing

,4.1.1,1289,2022-11-28 15:29:47+00:00,"*Revision 1289 – 28 November 2022*

See the release notes for [4.1](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1288-4.1) and [4.0.2](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1287-4.0.2) for major updates since 4.0.1 was released in August.

This release adds a single file for Language Server support that was missing in the 4.1 release from a few hours ago.

And if you'd like to try out the Language Server with Visual Studio Code, you can give [this project](https://github.com/kgtkr/processing-language-server-vscode) a try.

,4.1.2,1290,2023-01-16 21:26:16+00:00,"*Revision 1290 – 16 January 2023*

Happy [Martin Luther King Jr. day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day)!


## Contributions Manager

The majority of the work for this release went into cleaning up and fixing the Contributions Manager. (What you see when importing Libraries, managing Modes, etc.) Please, please, please help us out and give it a lot of testing. This is old, messy, and important code that is easy to break in major ways. If you have trouble with it, please file an issue!

* The “Manage Modes…” menu item was opening an empty window. [#613](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/613)

* Fix `Cannot invoke ""javax.swing.JProgressBar.setVisible(boolean)"" because ""this.progressBar"" is null` error when using Update All. [#618](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/618)

* Libraries from the Foundation (i.e. Video, Sound, and JavaFX) will now be reported properly on the [stats page](https://download.processing.org/stats/).

* Updated the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki#contributions) about Libraries, Modes, Tools, and Examples for Processing 4. These pages were copied over from the Processing 3 repository, but needed some cleaning. Still more work to do here, but it's a start.

* Implemented per-line indicators for download/install status. Eventually these will replace the progress bar in the bottom panel.

* Removed an old workaround for a `NullPointerException` while making selections. If it reappears, please file a new issue. [#3667](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3667)


## @SamPottinger saves us again

* “Cannot find a class or type named ‘PApplet’” error [#626](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/626), [#635](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/635)

* Cannot use `@Override` and `@Deprecated` in static mode [#619](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/619), [#622](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/622)

* `color` in imports shows up as an error in the editor (even though the code still runs) [#521](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/521), [#636](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/636)

* Sketch folders with spaces or hyphens showing errors in the editor window (even though the code still runs) [#610](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/610), [#637](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/637)


## Other Bug Fixes

* Help Menu sometimes disabled on macOS. This is a Java bug, but it's been closed as “cannot reproduce,” so I managed to find a workaround. [#4353](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4353#issuecomment-237715947), [#617](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/617), [#638](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/638)

* Fixed ClassCastException with `copy()` and `PGraphicsJava2D`. [#624](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/624)


## Additions? Why Not.

* The shortcuts for Find Next and Find Previous (i.e. ctrl-G and ctrl-shift-G on Windows/Linux) now work inside the Find/Replace window.

* Show a warning when calling `clear()` on the primary drawing surface. [#627](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/627)

* Preferences were not saved when closing Processing under certain circumstances. [#608](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/608)


## community contributin'

* Fix typos in French translation. [#661](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/661)

* Improved documentation for `lerpColor()` function. [#655](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/655)


## house cleanin'

* Warn users about multiple libraries with the same name.

,4.2,1292,2023-02-20 10:45:31+00:00,"*Revision 1292 – 20 February 2023*

Impress your friends with new `pde://` protocol handlers! With Processing 4.2, you can link to `.pdex` and `.pdez` files to immediately run and install libraries and sketches. How it works:

* Linking to `pde://processing.org/somesketch.pdez` in the browser will download `somesketch.pdez` and load it into the editor. It also works for files, for instance `pde:///Users/ada/Desktop/somesketch.pdez` will open an archive found on the Desktop.

* This also works for contributions (Libraries, Modes, Tools) archived as `.pdex` files.

Both file types are simply a renamed `.zip` file. So to create sketches in `.pdez` format, use Tools → Archive Sketch, and replace the `.zip` with `.pdez`.

This is implemented for macOS and Windows ([#559](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/559)), based on [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601082308/https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/219031308-How-to-launch-external-applications-using-custom-protocols-rock-instead-of-http-?mobile_site=true) which appears to be from @pboucher. Thank you! We still need help with implementing and testing it on Linux ([#674](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/674)). We would also like to add a warning dialog when opening files this way ([#560](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/560)).

In addition to the protocol handlers, there are a number of fixes in this release, especially for Windows users (and soon, for Python users).


## Windows users, we still love you

* The `.pde`, `.pdex`, and `.pdez` icons now work on Windows!

* Exporting projects to Windows resulted in “cannot find Java” errors, now fixed. [#667](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/667)


## Snake people, we love you too

* Several internal changes have been made to better support future releases of [Python Mode](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/tree/processing4). Fingers crossed that we'll be able to launch some of this soon.


## And still we fix the bugs

* Fix encoding problem in “has been resized from 100?100 to 116?100 by the window manager” messages when using OpenGL.

* `fullScreen(P2D)` not using the full screen when Windows display is scaled to fractional sizes. [#514](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/514).

* `Table.getString()` raises stack overflow when column type set to `double`. [#671](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/671)

* Added support chained decimals during SVG Parsing (contribution from @bsapozhnikov) [#515](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/515), [#659](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/659)

* Applications were being exported to the wrong folder. [#601](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/601)

* Fixed more `/tmp` folder problems on Linux.

,4.3,1293,2023-07-26 11:13:50+00:00,"*Revision 1293 – 26 July 2023*

This release incorporates several contributed fixes (see below) and a few additional bug fixes and changes. The icons have ben updated a bit so that Processing is less likely to be confused with Visual Studio Code when seen in the dock or task bar, and the splash screen colors and layout have design tweaks as well.

* Update documentation and process for updating language files for localization [722](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/722)

* Inherit dark mode from system settings on macOS [699](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/699)

* Use calculated text height instead of OS ascent for better vertical centering. *Note: this may cause some sketches to look slightly different if textAlign(..., CENTER) is being used.* [739](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/739)

* Bumped Java to 17.0.8+7.

* Fix `NullPointerException` when `background()` exceeds color range when writing PDF [740](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/740)
