  Figure \ref*{fig:processing-alpha-dot} shows a timeline of color coded post by category of the 15 most active contributors to the Alpha forum. Among them Ariel Malka (arielm), Jacok Schwartz (benelek) and Martin Gomez (Martin) were interviewed, on the basis of their participation in the forums, with no definitive indications of them assuming additional roles such as library contributor. We can observe certain patterns emerging such as initial posts being often in the Programing Help \& Questions section, often spanning out to others in the future. A part from co-creators Ben Fry (fry) and Casey Reas (REAS) we can also observe clustering of posts for users, suggesting periods of activity and inactivity.
