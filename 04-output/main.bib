  abstract = {Ben Fry is principal of Fathom Information Design, a design and software consultancy located in Boston. He received his doctoral degree from the Aesthetics + Computation Group at the MIT Media Laboratory, where his research focused on combining fields such as computer science, statistics, graphic design, and data visualization as a means for understanding information. After completing his thesis, he spent time developing tools for visualization of genetic data as a postdoc with Eric Lander at the Eli \& Edythe L. Broad Insitute of MIT \& Harvard. During the 2006-2007 school year, Ben was the Nierenberg Chair of Design for the Carnegie Mellon School of Design. At the end of 2007, he finished writing Visualizing Data for O’Reilly. In 2011, he won the National Design Award for Interaction Design from the Cooper-Hewitt. Casey Reas is a computational artist and co-developer of Processing, a programming language geared towards the visual arts. Reas is a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He holds a masters degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Media Arts and Sciences as well as a bachelor’s degree from the College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning at the University of Cincinnati. With Ben Fry, Reas initiated Processing in 2001. Processing is an open source programming language and environment for the visual arts. BEING MATERIAL:  In 1995, MIT’s Nicholas Negroponte predicted that “being digital” would have us entering a realm increasingly unconstrained by the materiality of the world. Two decades later, our everyday lives are indeed ever more suffused by computation and calculation. But unwieldy materiality persists and even reasserts itself. Programmable matter, self-assembling structures, 3D/4D printing, wearable technologies and bio-inspired design today capture the attention of engineers, scientists and artists. “BEING MATERIAL” showcased recent developments in materials systems and design, placing this work in dialogue with kindred and contrasting philosophy, art practice and critique. Panels on the PROGRAMMABLE, WEARABLE, LIVABLE and INVISIBLE—along with a concert, AUDIBLE—explored new and unexpected meetings of the digital and material worlds. PROGRAMMABLE: To program something is to impart a set of executable instructions into a medium to perform that process. From Ada Lovelace’s first hand-written program to today’s algorithmically animated robots, clothing, and living material, programmability has expanded its purview to embrace everything from the digital to the physical, from the synthetic to the biological, and from the scientific to the artistic. How have ideas about creativity, craft, and matter transformed in the process? What novel science and art emerges when material becomes programmable?},

  abstract = {The bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus". It is also known as the bus problem, truck factor, or bus/truck number.The concept is similar to the much older idea of key person risk, but considers the consequences of losing key technical experts, versus financial or managerial executives (who are theoretically replaceable at an insurable cost).  Personnel must be both key and irreplaceable to contribute to the bus factor; losing a replaceable or non-key person would not result in a bus-factor effect. The term was first applied to software development, where a team member might create critical components by crafting code that performs well, but which also is unavailable to other team members, such as work that was undocumented, never shared, encrypted, obfuscated or not published. Thus a key component would be effectively lost as a direct consequence of the absence of that team member, making the member key. If this component was key to the project's advancement, the project would stall.},

Certainly, OSS seems to hold much promise in addressing the core issues of the software crisis, namely that of software taking too long to develop, exceeding its budget, and not working very well. Indeed, there have been several examples of significant OSS success stories—the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the BIND domain name resolution utility, to name but a few. However, little by way of rigorous academic research on OSS has been conducted to date. In this study, a framework was derived from two previous frameworks which have been very influential in the IS field, namely that of Zachman’s IS architecture (ISA) and Checkland’s CATWOE framework from Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). The resulting framework is used to analyze the OSS approach in detail. The potential future of OSS research is also discussed.},

  abstract = {The ability to collect, store, and manage data is increasing quickly, but our ability to understand it remains constant. In an attempt to gain better understanding of data, fields such as information visualization, data mining and graphic design are employed, each solving an isolated part of the specific problem, but failing in a broader sense: there are too many unsolved problems in the visualization of complex data. As a solution, this dissertation proposes that the individual fields be brought together as part of a singular process titled Computational Information Design. This dissertation first examines the individual pedagogies of design, information, and computation with a focus on how they support one another as parts of a combined methodology for the exploration, analysis, and representation of complex data. Next, in order to make the process accessible to a wider audience, a tool is introduced to simplify the computational process for beginners, and can be used as a sketching platform by more advanced users. Finally, a series of examples show how the methodology and tool can be used to address a range of data problems, in particular, the human genome.},

  abstract = {In an insightful interview with Simon Greenwold, an early contributor to the Processing project, he reflects on the project’s inception and its evolution. Greenwold was one of the few who contributed core code in the project’s early stages, including significant rewrites of lighting and camera functionalities. He clarifies misconceptions about the extent of his contributions and the project's use of version control systems, noting the migration from Subversion to Git and the impact this had on the visibility of contributions. Greenwold provides context on the Processing project's roots in the Aesthetics and Computation Group (ACG) at MIT, where the goal was to simplify computational design to its essence. He discusses the dynamics within ACG, led by John Maeda, and its commitment to non-engineers in the design community, a stark contrast to the engineer-heavy teams typical of similar projects. He touches on the challenges of developing Processing in a pre-Git era and the subsequent import of its history into Git repositories. The interview also delves into the pedagogical use of Processing, with Greenwold sharing experiences of teaching computational design at Yale using Processing. He highlights the project's influence on students new to programming and the possibilities it opened for creative exploration. The discussion turns to the importance of Processing's open-source nature and the motivations behind contributors' engagement with the project. Simon Greenwold also reminisces about the early days of web-based deployment via Java applets, acknowledging the critical role this played in the project's dissemination and the ability to showcase work online. He acknowledges the astonishment at Processing's global impact, something neither he nor the project's founders could have anticipated. Lastly, Greenwold touches on the sustainability of Processing, expressing confidence in its continuity and admiration for Ben Fry's ongoing stewardship. The interview concludes with Greenwold expressing a keen interest in the outcomes of the thesis and a willingness to share visual materials from the ACG days to support the research. This interview provides a rich historical perspective on the Processing project, revealing the depth of commitment from its early contributors and the unique blend of technical innovation and creative design that has sustained its growth and relevance.}

  abstract = {Computation has become an essential tool for art and design. Yet many creative software tools limit users to preset options and filters, which may be restrictive for professional artists who have unique goals and workflows. While artists can learn to code to circumvent this preset functionality, the structured and abstract nature of programming is in tension with the exploratory and concrete nature of visual art making. From Photoshop to Processing, tools give artists the power to create, but the designers of such tools also exert power over artists by dictating what is available to them. This dissertation offers three contributions towards understanding, enabling, and questioning power relationships in software tools for visual art. First, through a thematic analysis of interviews with over a dozen professional artists, I show that pre-existing software tools are most powerful when they enable fine grain aesthetic control and adaptable to artists’ idiosyncratic workflows, and that artists learn to program their own tools to gain various forms of power. Second, to support visual artists in programming, I present the Demystified Dynamic Brushes (DDB) system. DDB is a creative coding environment that visualizes program information on the ongoing artwork and grounds debugging interactions with stylus inputs, giving artists the power to understand their programs in a way aligned with their existing expertise. Finally, I argue that the traditional way software tools empower their users—through defining abstractions and representations that align with user needs—also disempower them by exerting a “normative ground” that structures and limits how users can and should act, think, and express themselves. Backed by interviews with creative practitioners and tool designers, I build a preliminary theory of how power relationships manifest in creativity support tools, and what tool designers can do, both technically and methodologically, to mitigate imbalances in power relationships. Taken together, it is my goal to show that supporting creative practices beyond accomplishing tasks with more efficiency or lower mental load—-supporting wonderful creative practices that are unpredictable, emergent, and messy—means taking power relationships—and creative practitioners themselves—more seriously in software design.},

The conversation touches on the importance of community, open source contributions, and the challenges of gaining recognition in the rapidly changing landscape of digital art and programming. Malka's narrative is not only a personal reflection but also sheds light on the broader shifts in technology, programming languages, and the dynamics of community-driven development.},

  abstract = {This interview with Ricard Marxer explores his early engagement with the Processing project during his Master's in Arts and Digital Arts around 2004. Ricard recounts his transition from communications engineering to digital arts, driven by a desire to merge artistic expression with coding. He describes his initial frustration with available tools and how discovering Processing fulfilled his need for a code-centric graphics environment, allowing him to delve into vector graphics and Bezier curves without excessive boilerplate code. During the interview, Ricard reminisces about his academic journey, his unexpected shift from a potential research career to digital arts due to administrative hurdles, and his continued passion for combining technology with art. He also discusses the development of his 'Geomerative' library for Processing, designed to manipulate typography vectors, which emerged from his master's thesis. Ricard reflects on the evolution of open-source contributions, his interactions with the Processing community through forums, and the support he received from other artists and developers. He touches on the importance of open-source as a collaborative and educational tool and acknowledges how his contributions led to opportunities for teaching and connecting with like-minded individuals. Furthermore, Ricard shares his perspective on the growth of Processing, its leadership dynamics, and the challenges of managing open-source projects, especially as they scale. The interview concludes with Ricard expressing a renewed interest in generative art amidst the rise of generative AI, inspired by his past work and current technological trends.},

It seeks to provide a background overview of research in this area through a review of selected empirical studies of F/OSSD processes. The results and findings from a survey of empirical studies of F/OSSD give rise to an interesting variety of opportunities and challenges for understanding these processes, which are identified along the way. Overall, what becomes clear is that studies of F/OSSD processes reveal a more diverse set of different types of processes than have typically been examined in conventional software development projects. The articles in this special issue further advance understanding of what processes characterize and shape F/OSSD. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this insightful interview, Ricard Marxer discusses his early encounters with the Processing community, tracing back to his academic tenure at the University of California, Santa Barbara, around 2002-2003. With a background in Media Arts and Technology, Marxer recounts the limited tools available to artists and designers at that time, such as Flash and Director, which were predominant before the advent of Processing. Marxer's initial foray into Processing was out of necessity during his final year project where he developed the OSC P5 library, influenced by the creative environment at UCSB that blended visual arts with music. The interview delves into the hybrid program at UCSB, which was instrumental in Marxer's exploration of Open Sound Control and interfacing different applications, leading to his later work on Control P5. This library emerged from Marxer's desire to have a more efficient workflow, enabling control over visuals without constant code alterations. After his academic journey, Marxer's professional trajectory took him to Berlin, where he worked for Art+Com and further developed Control P5 in his spare time. The discussion touches upon the generative design and the art community's curiosity around Processing during the early stages. Marxer reflects on the community forums, his contributions, the evolution of library sharing, and the shifts from a more casual to a formalized process. Marxer also shares insights into the technical infrastructure of the time, the absence of version control, and the reliance on personal management of code versions, contrasting with today's GitHub-centric practices. His journey with Processing and its libraries highlights a self-taught path through the evolving landscape of design and code, leading to current teaching practices with p5.js. The interview concludes with Marxer's observations on the enduring nature of Processing, its educational impact, and its role in the history of computational design. Despite facing criticism for performance issues, Processing's accessibility and simplicity continue to make it a foundational tool for many in the field. Marxer expresses interest in the future of computational design tools and their integration into various industries, and he commends Tibor Udvari's efforts in documenting the history and influence of Processing through his research.},

This book details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish walks readers through the steps of creating better graphs and how to move beyond simple line, bar, and pie charts. Through more than five hundred examples, he demonstrates the do's and don'ts of data visualization, the principles of visual perception, and how to make subjective style decisions around a chart's design. Schwabish surveys more than eighty visualization types, from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explains how each has its place in the visual toolkit. It might seem intimidating, but everyone can learn how to create compelling, effective data visualizations.

  abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures  through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them.  Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, meme spread, information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, peer learner networks, business networks, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. These networks are often visualized through sociograms in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.Social network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology. It has also gained significant popularity in the following - anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies, economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, political science, public health,  social psychology, development studies, sociolinguistics, and computer science, education and distance education research, and is now commonly available as a consumer tool (see the list of SNA software).The advantages of SNA are twofold. Firstly, it can process a large amount of relational data and describe the overall relational network structure. tem and parameter selection to confirm the influential nodes in the network, such as in-degree and out-degree centrality. SNA context and choose which parameters to define the “center” according to the characteristics of the network. Through analyzing nodes, clusters and relations, the communication structure and position of individuals can be clearly described.},

  abstract = {Logo is more than a programming language. It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first computer language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN).             Logo’s design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget’s constructivism and Marvin Minsky’s artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo’s foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables.             Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer’s potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.},

The primary unit of analysis of this process is neither the individual nor social institutions, but the informal 'communities of practice' that people form as they pursue shared enterprises over time. To give a social account of learning, the theory explores in a systematic way the intersection of issues of community, social practice, meaning, and identity. The result is a broad framework for thinking about learning as a process of social participation. This ambitious but thoroughly accessible framework has relevance for the practitioner as well as the theoretician, presented with all the breadth, depth, and rigor necessary to address such a complex and yet profoundly human topic.},
