\subsubsection*{Evolution of Community Discussion Platforms}
In the early days of the Processing project, community interactions predominantly took place on forums. These forums served as a primary channel for users to share experiences, discuss problems, and seek help. Notably, the forum discussions underwent significant transformations in terms of platforms over the years, as can be observed in Table \ref{table:forums}. \parencite{ProcessingForum}

This dynamic shift from one platform to another indicates an evolving user-base and a growing set of needs and tools that community members require for effective collaboration.
